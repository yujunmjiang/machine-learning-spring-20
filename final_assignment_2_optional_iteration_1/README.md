Classification Task
[Flying Dollar Airport](http://flyingdollar.com/) is a small, public-use airport in the Poconos with a 2,400 foot turf runway. A Nest Cam is pointed at a 200 foot section in the middle of the runway. When the Nest Cam detects activity, a static image is captured. “Activity” is any significant movement in the frame. This includes aircraft arrivals and departures, but also includes many other things such as cloud movement, animals, rain, snow, trees moving in the wind, people, vehicles, the movement of light, and other motion.
