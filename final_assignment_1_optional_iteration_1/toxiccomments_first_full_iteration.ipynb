When the CRU presents evidence of a hack, it can be called a hack.  Until such time, Occam's Razor leans towards it being either the act of a whistle-blower, or (since there is significant evidence in both the computer code itself, and in previous errant leaks of accidentally putting files on a web server that they did not intend to release) that this is typical data mismanagement because Jones and CRU apparently wouldn't hire anybody with any IT professionals (for fear that anyone outside the cabal would have blown the whistle a decade ago?)

And the bureaucrats tried to take her child. In that institution there were a number of women locked up that just had given birth.

We had to keep my sister hidden from the authorities for several months while we informed the politicians and gathered evidence to defend ourselves against the bureaucrats. Finally with the help of some politicians the bureaucrats were made to stop their efforts to take my sisters child and locking her up again. Afterwards our lawyer said that as far as she knew we were the first family ever in Sweden to manage to keep a child in spite the bureaucrats being on full attack.

The film then skips to a scene where Lara is seen from the man's point of view continuing their talk in a bar. Slightly intoxicated at this point, the man slips a few Rohypnol tablets into her drink. All becomes a blur, then the film skips to a scene of a visibly confused Lara in a dark, unidentified location. Her facial muscles struggle to move as she clearly tries to resist, in vain, the advances of the man who begins tearing her clothes off. Soon afterwards, the man drops his own clothing and proceeds to insert his bare erect PENIS into her rectum without lubrication. After some struggle from the woman, she eventually concedes and gives in to the constrictions of the phallus, which by this point is starting to gather fecal matter along the course of its shaft. The film ends with a closeup of the unknown man's semen resting at the entrance to her rectum.\n",

So, since I wrote the words you complain about, it should be obvious that they are not intended to make Tyson seem in any way correct. I would be in favor of making this clearer by quoting someone to the effect that attributing to Isaiah the intent to take credit for star charts drawn up a millennia after Isaiah's death is profoundly stupid, but I was in a hurry to replace a vacancy on the page and an appropriate source didn't spring to mind. In any case, I am adamantly opposed to the change you propose, since it removes all specifics, leaving a tasteless gruel, and I don't see anything particularly \"\"encyclopedic\"\" about bad writing. The bit about Yahweh is directly from Tyson's acknowledgement of error on Facebook, btw, where he still shows no inkling of how moronic his interpretation of Bush's Biblical quotation is.   \"\n",

At some point someone will put their foot down and say enough is enough this behavior is inappropriate and there will be consequences. You can't act like this it is called a power trip.

When Tracy Lord (played by Kelly) awakens hungover on her wedding day, she doesn’t at first remember anything about her previous night’s drunken carousing, but comes to believe she “made love” with Mike the reporter (played by Sinatra) and discusses it at length with her ex-husband Dexter (played by Crosby). At the time, of course, \"\"making love\"\" was generally understood in a more amorous than sexual sense. Being a romantic comedy, “High Society” plays all of this for laughs while cheering for the real loves to uncover themselves by the end of the last reel.\n",
