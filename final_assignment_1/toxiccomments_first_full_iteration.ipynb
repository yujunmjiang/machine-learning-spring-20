      "\n",
      "A new study conducted by Mark Regnerus, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Texas has revealed, among other things, that 40% of children (aged 18 to 39) whose parents are homosexual have had an affair while married or cohabiting, compared to only 13% of children from heterosexual families. It also showed that 23% of children whose parents are lesbian or gay have been touched sexually by a parent or an adult, compared to 2% of children from heterosexual families, and that 31% of them have had sex against their will, compared to 8% from heterosexual families. The study stresses, however, that it would be wrong to conclude from its data that the abuser was necessarily one of the parents, or that the abuse had anything to do with the parent's sexual orientation. The study also shows that 12% of those with lesbian parents and 24% of those with homosexual fathers have considered suicide, compared to 5% of those from heterosexual families. Children with homosexual parents are also more than twice as likely to be in therapy \"\"for a problem connected with anxiety, depression or relationships\"\" - 19% of children compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. Furthermore, 20% of children with lesbian parents and 25% of children with homosexual fathers have had a sexually transmitted disease, compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. 28% of children with lesbian parents and 20% of children with homosexual fathers are currently unemployed compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. Adult children with homosexual parents are also more likely to smoke marijuana and to get arrested.\n",

      "Ensure that the picture clearly shows as much of the character as possible:\n",

      "Colouring should be neutral - pictures which have a heavy colour cast, or otherwise depict the character with false colours should not be uploaded unless the cast has been removed first.\n",
      "Heavily stylised art should only be considered for use when the character is closely associated with the style to the exclusion of less extreme styles.\n",
      "Pictures which have more characters and/or objects than the subject of the article should only be used if the subject is the most prominent object - editing the picture, by cropping, obscuring and/or painting out the other characters may help to ensure this.\n",

      "Singer Rozz then joined the band “Pompeii 99' founded by singer, guitarist, song writer Valor.\n",
      "Rozz took over vocals leaving Valor to focus on guitar. Before Rozz joined Pompeii 99, the band had already released their fist album “Look At Yourself” to much acclaim, which had an apocalyptic theme with a punk rock flavor. The Pompeii 99 had been planning their first tour when it was proposed by their French record company, to merge Pompeii 99 into a new version of Christian Death which after some debate was agreed upon. Thus, began the new Christian Death and the first Pompeii 99 tour became the first Christian Death tour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Part way through the tour the band stopped in Wales to record songs, some of which were originally intended for the next Pompeii 99 album. The fusion of which led to the unique sound of the classic “Catastrophe   Ballet”.\n",
      "Like the first Pompeii 99 album, Catastrophe Ballet had an apocalyptic theme, however the music morphed into something not quite Pompeii 99 and nothing like the first Christian Death album. After the tour the band returned to LA to later record the 3rd Christian Death album”Ashes”which was a post apocalyptic vision of a cold and bleak future. \n",
      "\n",
      "After confirming the 2nd tour in 85 singer Rozz quit the band. Valor returned to vocals, the band embarked on the 2nd tour. In Italy the band recorded the mini album “The Wind Kissed Pictures”, a surrealist view of a mystical past. Almost immediately work began on the 4th full length album “Atrocities” inspired by the atrocities of World War II and the connection to future shock waves. While continuously touring in 87 the band released the 5th and now classic album “The Scriptures”, the theme of which explored world religion and how the legacy of these beliefs impact our world today.\n",
      "\n",
      "1988 Brought us the release of “Sex & Drugs & Jesus Christ”. This was turning point for the band. The cover depicted an image of Jesus shooting up heroin. This was a full frontal attack by Valor against the Church with a scathing heretical mockery of organized Christianity. The band then found themselves confronted by protesters, riots and bomb threats, These events and the bands imagery and fashion went on to influence the likes of Nine Inch Nails, Korn, Marilyn Manson, Type O Negative, every Goth band on the planet and many others.\n",
      "\n",
      "1989 saw the release of the double album epic “All the Love, All the Hate” interpreting the juxtaposition between life and death, day and night, man and woman, black and white.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1991 came the release of “Insanus, Ultio, proditio, Misericordiaque”, with its theme of an ancient dream state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Late in 91, after being in several other bands and seven years after quitting Christian Death, Rozz was persuaded by unscrupulous profiteers to perform at a concert in Los Angels under the name Christian Death. On the same day Christian Death was in Europe performing in Paris, France. Assuming this was a one time effort to earn extra cash, as explained to Valor\n",

(the overabundance of quotation marks is one symptom, but there are other, such as the \"\"for the benefit of Europeans\"\", which takes away from the neutral tone an encyclopedic article.) I'm not an expert on the subject (in fact I know very little about it, which is why I came here), but even to me it would be better if the page instead sourced a number of published treatises/works on the subject instead of going into a quasi-emotional and ambiguous personal essay-style on the subject. It sounds to me like the article attempts to unite the various concepts and make it as culturally vague and generalized and \"\"acceptable\"\" (as in, lacking cultural, ritual and mythical specifics that would make different versions more characterized) as possible - and this makes the article sounds a little - dare I say - \"\"New Agey\"\". (for lack of a better term.) I think more people would appreciate more specific mythic instances and rituals that specifically dealt with the Great Spirit/Mystery (and also those that established important differences between various views on the subject, as one would expect from proper research) - if those are available - as opposed to the currently rather watered-out explanation. \n",

There are some extant citations in the text, like{{citation |title=Roads to Diversity: Adams Morgan Heritage Trail |url=http://www.culturaltourismdc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/AMHT_English.pdf |author=Cultural Tourism DC |date=2005}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?node=cityguide/profile&id;=799601 |title=Meridian Hill Park: Sports and Recreation Locations in Washington, DC on washingtonpost.com's City Guide |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}. You can see that the references are framed by  (or ) and  in HTML-like markup. You use named references if you are going to use a particular reference more than once.

Often, for book references, you can dispense with extensive context after the first reference, and just say Smith, p. 15 and go on.\n",

In 1997, Smash Hits debated whether or not to put the boyband Damage on the front cover of an issue of their publication. They felt that, as the band were black, this may mean that they would suffer a loss of sales for that issue. It was mistakenly thought that Smash Hits had never previously had a band with an all black line up on the cover when in fact the likes of Sade, Neneh Cherry and Five Star had featured on the front page.\n",

      "This was an operation done with full knowledge of top levels of the USG Intelligence Community who monitored it. Several former Soviet-bloc physicists were brought in as consultants including Dr. Valdimir Poponin, allegedly a personal acquaintance of Gorbachev's. We were interested in evaluating the controversial claims of \"\"Russian torsion field weapons\"\" and, therefore brought Gennady Shipov over from Moscow several times. On one trip Shipov lived with Sarfatti for about 2 weeks. Richard Hammond, and American physicist from Fargo working on torsion fields for US Navy at one time was brought in as well as R. Kiehn a former scientist for US SAC and retired professor from University of Houston.  Shipov worked with Akimov in Moscow who allegedly had strong military connections in the Soviet era. Sarfatti was the senior theorist on the American side of the ISSO core staff that included Saul-Paul Sirag. He arranged for Creon Levit to be borrowed from NASA AMES to run the daily operations of the project. Over a million dollars was given to SARA, a TRW spinoff DOD contractor in Huntington, Beach CA to further test a system developed by Jim Corum. Corum also wrote papers on \"\"The Philadelphia Experiment\"\" and had entre to the Tesla Archive in Beograd even during the Cold War. This was unusual. Corum later went to ISR in W.Va, a think tank doing exotic work with USG funds provided by Senator Robert Byrd and his Congressional counter-part in his home district. The key objective, of course, was to try to figure out how the \"\"saucers\"\" really flew. All of the key scientists had interest in that, with the possible exception of Hammond and Kiehn. Harold Puthoff was brought in as a consultant. Ken Shoulders was also involved as were many others whose schemes were tested. The key foreign figure was Professor J. P. Vigier from Paris who had been Louis DeBroglie's assistant for decades. Sarfatti arranged for a Telegraph Hill Penthouse for Vigier to spend extended periods meeting the scientists flowing through ISSO. Vigier and Levit made a trip to Budapest in 2000 to meet with two Serbian physicists  Z.Maric  & A. Dragic who were experimentally testing an exotic atomic energy release idea of Vigier's of obvious interest to USG Intelligence because of its WMD implications. See the paper \"\"On the possible Existence of Tight Bound States in Quantum Mechanics\"\". pp 349-356 of the same volume of one of Sarfatti's papers, i.e. Vol 126 of Fundamental Theories of Physics, ISBN 1-4020-0885-6. This is not a coincidence. There are few coincidences in \"\"this Looking Glass War Twilight Zone interface between physics and politics\"\" to quote Sarfatti in one of his more eloquent moments. ;-) In fact, ISSO paid most of the expenses for the meeting upon which the volume is based. Enuff said. I hope this helps to somewhat clarify Sarfatti's multiple roles in these events. Sarfatt is a kind of a canary in the mind shaft for MASINT. For example, he was quite alarmed about an immanent attack on important US Military targets in the Fall of 2001. Sarfatti wrote numerous e-mails on this during July & Aug 2001. It seems to be a case of precognitive remote viewing. Unfortunately, Sarfatti was not able to pinpoint the exact time and place of the attack (attacks). He had guessed Oct 2001 because of some big anti-space weapons rally by leftist groups scheduled for that time at Lockheed-Martin. [User:UFO_Black_Ops]]  Oct 16, 2005\"\n",

Given that Firefly is proving to be a failure at the box office by the well accepted formula of Movie Cost > Box Office Take, I am suggesting we start formulating a way to add that to the article.

Additional to say we can't mention our like or dislike of the film seems to suggest you think personal opinion can't be expressed on Wikipedia Talk pages.

      " an incident has occurred within the church involving some type of sexual scandal. There is a discussion between the churches ip and members of Wikipedia if this  Between 1984 and 1989 John Langworthy was a youth minister at Prestonwood Baptist Church. On January 22nd, 2013, Langworthy pled guilty to five of eight felony counts of gratification of lust against young boys, receiving a suspended sentence of 50 years. He was also required to register as a sex offender. The offences occurred at Morrison Heights Baptist Church in Clinton, MS.[11] It was reported that Langworthy also admitted, in a pulpit confession, to prior sex offenses at Prestonwood Baptist Church. Some of the alleged victims made complaints to Prestonwood Church at the time, which were dealt with internally by church officials.[12] There are now allegations that Prestonwood Baptist Church covered up Langworthy's offenses by failing to report them to the proper authorities.

      "Posted on 29 August, 2006\n",
      "\n",
      " Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. \n",
      "\n",
      "The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. \n",
      "\n",
      "Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 \n",
      "\n",
      "A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” \n",
      "\n",
      "In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” \n",
      "\n",
      "As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Worship Rights \n",
      "\n",
      "In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.” \n",
      "\n",
      "The bishop did not respond to questions about whether individuals in Ajaltoun had the right to change their religious affiliation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Abou-Mekhael told Compass today that the church remains officially sealed, and that he is in the process of filing a case against the attackers. He also said that his congregation of approximately 80 people is ready to open a second case if they are denied their constitutional right to worship at the site. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Even if we get permission to remove the red wax, there are still threats from the mayor and from the bishop that if we go to worship they will attack again,” the pastor told Compass. “By the constitution of Lebanon, we have the freedom to worship there. But they say, ‘Okay, go try to practice your rights, but we will stop you.’” \n",

Here is a link to their new show: . That is the best wrestling going today. TNA lost all sense of direction. I hope they get back to their old ways, but now they seem like Raw. A crap load of promos and about 20 minutes of wrestling. Though last week's episode was very good. TNA are trying to raise the bar with Samoa Joe's new gimmick in which he gets himself DQed then beat the living hell out of the guy. Last week he hung a guy upside down by his feet and beat him like a pinata with a kendo stick. It was funny and great. Most hate it, since it is controversial, but I loved it. They need to raise the bar. Check it out if you want. They have a few good things going now but at the moment WWE are doing better. Hopefully after the storyline involving The Main Event Mafia and The Front Line in over, they'll go back to their old ways. Sting is supposed to retire this year. Angle might head back to WWE. If that is the case, then we'll get new blood in the main event.

Instigating a firefight that is almost certain to cost the lives of many if not all the crew members of the MV Faina where one might not be necessary would be astonishingly stupid. At present the order of the day is containment while negotiations are carried out to secure a peaceful outcome. In any case if the ship were to be boarded it would be done by special operations units who would have been very unlikely to have been aboard the American vessel when the crisis arose.

This claim has some logic in the context of the events, but I have not seen this claim made in any serious source. If this is due to my ignorance, I suggest ProhibitOnions provides at least some references, or, if he can't find them off hand, at least gives some hints where he saw this info, so that it can be checked. His statement on the talk page that \"\"many historians concede\"\" on this is too vague of a reference. If this is indeed his own speculation based on his interpretation of the logic of events, this qualifies as original research, whose place is current scholary or popular publications, personal web-sites, etc., but not an encyclopedia, which should reflect an established knowledge.\n",

My point is that this info is factually accurate, but its relevance is too remote. Deliberate killing milions of people was a horrible crime, but Kiev itself, unlike the vast regions of Ukrainian countryside, was not ravaged by famine. Should the info on the deliberate famine caused by the actions of the Bolshevik government be introduced into every article related to any Ukrainian topic? If PO helps me understand why famine should be in Kiev article, I am open to ideas. \n",

Finally, PO removed from the article the statement that Kiev growth was mostly caused by migration from other parts of Ukraine which indeed re-established Ukrainian spirit in the city, which is confirmed, for example, by a relative rise of Ukrainian theater and literature in Kiev at the time. He substituted it by the statement about \"\"the migration from other parts of the Soviet Union.\"\" Where does he get this info?\n",

      "I know little about formula 1 or what they're up to these days. There's relatively little use of it in the '40s for aircraft and that's fairly well known - except the R-R Griffon, which had some experimental use as a turbo-compound but is still in the archives.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I can add is about the origins. In the 1930s, diesels were undergoing substantial development. High-speed diesels were having forced induction applied. Particularly in work by Saurer, there was an effort to see just how much boost was practical. In contrast to petrol engines, it was found that it was relatively easy apply a high boost of maybe 6 bar without problems such as detonation. These high boost engines were mostly using centrifugal superchargers. What then became a problem was how to extract mechanically all of the extra thermodynamic energy released. The engine was now running with an effective compression ratio far in excess of the piston's mechanical compression. Considering the piston power stroke as an expansion phase in a heat engine, there just wasn't enough stroke or expansion for the combustion gases to do enough work on the crankshaft! The exhaust still remained hot and pressured, with much of the energy still remaining in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "A solution was the turbo-compound. By running the exhaust through an expansion turbine, more of this energy could be extracted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turbo-compounds were difficult though. Just coupling the fast turbine shaft to the slow crankshaft was a problem, especially as there really needed to be a variable speed drive in there too. \n",
      "\n",
      "What was realised though was that driving the mechanical supercharger required substantial power. About as much power as could easily be extracted from the exhaust turbine. So coupling one to the other directly provided a neat solution to supercharger drives, and avoided the need for turbo compounding the exhaust turbine. This was effectively a parallel evolution to the Buchi turbocharging system that had been tried some years earlier and would now become the dominant approach for supercharging large four stroke diesels at constant loads (Two strokes in vehicles usually stuck with Roots blowers, as they gave better scavenging at low speeds).\n",

First of all, I am not arguing over the number of each ethnic group but instead you are. I never changed the numbers, rather I changed and replaced the old 1980, hard to read and understand map of yours. My map, the one above, explains little more about each Ethnic group, while yours does not. Demographics of Afghanistan should not just be the numbers of each group but also include a brief explanation about who or what these people are and or where they originate from. By watching your actions and you keep insisting that your map remains in Afghanistan's article, there must be something you are up to. Also something I noticed, you keep talking about the numbers of Pashtuns should be lower, which indicates that you wish to see them die or something. I will slowly look around for an administrator to help with removing and deleting your silly outdated man soon. I wish not to bother talking or discussing anything with you as I find that you are not a nice person to talk or socialize with. You keep reminding that Pashtuns killed this Pashtuns killed that, why don't you discuss about Pashtuns always being killed by invaders. They have the right to rule their country and they have the right to kill anyone they find as a traitor to their country. This law is practiced in all the countries of the world. By now I've already realized that you are not just a traitor to Afghanistan but also a true enemy of Pashtuns. I have Allah (Almighty God) on my side and that's why I always win.\n",

That is, I believe there should be a preference to use usual English names, while you appear to have a preference for the default romanization. It seems to me, that \"\"Star City\"\" is the English name for this region - whether incorporated or not. Notice on other language Wikipedias, including the Russian Wikipedia, they don't have two articles on the area.. after all, the Russian names are the same. Maybe there's a dispute here on English Wikipedia because the English name (the one originally used by NASA) is different from the default transliteration (just like Korolev / Korolyov).  \n",

In particular, WP:COMMONNAME doesn't require the sources to be \"\"dictionaries\"\". But WP:RUS does require the sources to be dictionaries, and I believe this difference is causing problems. WP:RUS is not a key Policy or Guideline (maybe it's more like a WikiProject advice page, that achieved wide support in 2007); as such it should elaborate on the key policies, not change them. I think the \"\"dictionary\"\" requirement should be reworded, to allow for situations where the place name doesn't occur in a dictionary, but can still has a conventional English name.\n",

The things are quite complicated and there is another possibility for the origin of the latinized version Carolus and I do not think it directly comes from *Kar(i)laz, because Carolus was borrowed from Germanic, when Common Germanic had already disappeared for a long time, that is quite hypothetic, and there is another possible etymology. See for example this very well documented site . I suppose Carolus was borrowed from Old High German or Old Franconian. That is why I do not accept the very shortened statement *Kar(i)laz > Carolus. I agree totally about Carolus > Charles, with some typical French phonetic shifts. I know that the meaning of churl is different, but it is the same etymological root, ultimatly from *kar(i)laz, sure, but through an intermediate West Germanic form *keril-.

Since you seem to have all the right skills, I wondered whether you might be tempted to work more on the Middleham Hoard article or on other English Civil War hoards with support from York Museums Trust's numismatics curator ?

I don't pretend to be an archaeologist (a couple of digs and a term at university in the late 1970s hardly count), but I enjoy contributing to archaeological articles precisely because I am not an expert in the field, and editing helps me learn more about subjects that interest me.   \n",

That doesn't mean Wikipedia relies on a democratic definition of truth. If we did, we would have to state, as a fact, that God exists, because a majority of the world's English-speaking people believe that claim to be true. Fortunately for God, he's still got some gaps to hide in, so for the time being the existence of God is not a scientific question. But anthropogenic global warming certainly is, and this is probably one of the aspects of scientific consensus that stands in greatest contradiction to popular belief. The vast majority of ordinary people display no detectable concern about continuing to burn fossil fuels, and a sizable fraction either deny that burning fossil fuels can possibly influence the climate, or doubt that the influence would be harmful. Wikipedia can certainly report on who believes what. We have a List of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming.\n",

      "I have made no \"\"legal threat\"\" to anyone. It is a matter of an apparent breach  of a moral obligation by Sven Manguard to me. I worked hard with Wikimedia Australia over a three-month period to develop an idea in great detail, which is complex and has many original elements. I conveyed some of the details to Manguard after he assured me he had no intention of developing anything remotely similar. I was then told by a third party that \"\"Sven grabbed me on IRC to tell me he is planning a similar project\"\" and that Sven had said \"\"well, I'm going ahead with it\"\". Manguard has since said on my talk page, \"\"you missed your chance, your partnership fell through, and if there is even the slightest chance of it coming to fruition, it's not going to be for several more months. I'm not going to drop my efforts, and I'm not going to wait indefinitely for something that at this point I'm pretty sure is never going to happen ...\"\". Actually, the partnering institution had already agreed in principle, and there has simply been a delay in implementation. I have been led to believe that others in the WMF have been apprised of the idea; but I'm in the dark as to what level of detail he has divulged, and whether clearly identifiable details of my scheme have been or will be duplicated without attribution. If distinctive and original details are being conveyed contrary to his undertaking to me, it is a moral breach; and if they are implemented without attribution to me, that is also a moral breach; if this occurs, I believe I have a moral right to inform people of it. This is the gist of what I said to Manguard, but now I'm been accused of making \"\"legal threats\"\"; this is based on a complete misunderstanding. In fact, I don't have a legal foot to stand on in that respect, and he knows it. Why is this being construed as anything \"\"legal\"\"? For all we know, Manguard's ideas might be quite different; but he needs to communicate them as a courtesy as much as a practicality.I was the person who suggested publicly that Manguard and Adam be \"\"directors\"\" at FSC, only a few weeks ago. I believe Manguard has done good work there, so I don't understand why this spin-out is happening. It has quickly morphed into accusations of \"\"gross incivility, threats of off-wiki harassment, and personal attacks\"\". I see no evidence of gross incivility by me (aside from an unkind thing I said on his talk page yesterday—\"\"not mature enough\"\"—which I'm willing to withdraw), nor of personal attacks. Instead, I have endured major and repeated personal attacks on his and my talk pages. No one has mentioned those.This seems to have been mixed up with complaints about my reviewing at FSC: they are surely two different issues. If people are troubled by professional reviews of soundfiles, I think there's a big problem for features sounds. I have presented factual evidence and what I believe are balanced opinions, and have supported a few WP-produced files, too. I encourage WPians to present their own performances for FS promotion, just as our photographers do at FSC, but please let's review them professionally without fear or favour.  (talk) \"\n",

This article is being expanded with material for the first time in years and it'd be easier to keep it separate while its being improved. Clearly the LaRouche movment includes many discrete organizations, many of which have overlapping personnel and aims, and some of which are notable enough on their own for articles. For example, the U.S. Labor Party probably deserves an article because every little political party gets an article. OTOH, the National Democratic Policy Committee, while in some ways equally important, probably doesn't merit an article and should be covered in one of the other LaRouche articles. Most of the PACs or campaign comittees are covered in the presidental campaign articles, but thousands of other candidates also ran under  LaRouche-affilitiated groups.

How on earth are the rebels resisting? Also, lol, they make the ISIS pigs hold only 10% of Saker Island for MONTHS now, how on earth they can't take control of that small area that Masdar and Lucem claim they don't hold? Also, Masdar numbers are as far-fetched as SOHR's. Really, they claim 200 Nusra(not counting other rebels) deaths in Shaykh Miskin by 10 of November. After that, we had over a month of a bloody battle, so likely the rebels suffered even more deaths, and they also said that hundreds more of Nusra fighters we're injured. But the estimated number of Nusra numbers in Daara is 3.000. How would they hold together after losing effectively 1/6 of their forces in TEN DAYS, specially since they battled in Shaykh Miskin for a month after that. Yeah, all forces that lose 1/6 of their forces in a single battle, that only in 10 days, are capable of fighting the same battle for a extra month and still be existing. Makes much sense.

To resolve this, I created redirects into the list with verbose titles like R1: Explosive when dry.

      "The Cosmology part is not by me. I only corrected some really impossibly wrong aspects that someone inserted on a spree of misguided grandiosity. I really have only fixed false stuff, never really written anything but those pieces in the articles we did together. At one point recently (the other day) I nearly eliminated all the Cosmology section and referenced the God Speaks article instead. Then I thought that was too bold, even though that's what my heart says to do. I didn't want to do something that radical without others. But my feeling is that the God Speaks article is much better than the Cosmology section in the Meher Baba article, and that it should only appear in the God Speaks section. So my feeling is still to toss out much of the stuff on the Baba article and if there is anything good or that we missed move it to the God Speaks article. Also, if there is quarelling over these issues in the future, it won't reflect as badly on the main Meher Baba article as it will be a side article. So that's my vote. Sorry I haven't contributed much yet. I find myself pretty shy when it comes to writing. I mostly just try to keep out stuff that is utterly silly.  21:32\n",

      "All ancient sources (I AM a historian) mention about 30,000 Dacian warriers in the first war (the so called \"\"Scond Battle of Tapae\"\"😉, which was not at all a battle of Tapae, but the battle for Sarmizegetusa, a few miles only further, never conquered by the romans, which fled scared shitless to Adamclisi, 700km further east, where the battle for the Dacian capital Sarmizegetusa also ended! With a shrine inscripted with more than 3,000 fallen roman soldiers, only the limited wall surface of the shrine limiting the names inscriptions.., this also being called by you \"\"a decissive roman victory\"\"😉 for Sarmizegetusa, not conqered at that time by the romans, which started towards it but were stopped at Tapae, and when the Dacians stopped fighting because of the legendary \"\"strange storm\"\", \"\"anger of the Dacian Gods\"\", and they were defenceless, the romans, also a few miles only from Sarmizgetusa and open for taking, ran as crazy 700km in 4 days, to their reserve troops at Adamclisi.. and you call this \"\"decisive roman victory\"\"😉), and 15,000 Dacian soldiers in the second big war, of AD 105, ending in 106AD.\n",
      "This correct troops amount stayed a few decades (anyway many years; I made screenshots at some point for a school documentary), and only recently somebody vandalised the site changing the amount in a couple of hundred thousands, with NO SOURCE REFERENCES what so ever, and he couldn't do it too as all historical info points out the tiny Dacian army at that time.\n",
      "YOU, as administrator, in sted of correcting the vandalism and restore the page, didn't give a damn..\n",
      "When I came and restored the info, doing YOUR JOB, you acuse me of \"\"vandalism\"\"😉, and that \"\"I am partial to the Dacians\"\", while you are the one partial to the romans and to vandalism.\n",
      "Further more, you acuse me that \"\"being partial to the Dacians\"\"😉, I said that the Dacians won, not the romans, adding that \"\"I did not attach sources ref./proof\"\"😉.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the page of the First Battle of Tapae, was allways mentioned (with source ref. attached; poorly and only 1 source while there are many.. but OK) that the governer (of the invading roman army in the DACIAN Moesia) was killed together with his army (that is correct). \n",
      "This first battle of Tapae (again BS; it was the battle of the romams for Sarmizegetusa, also stopped at Tapae, Sarmizwgetusa was NOT conquered, that's why was called The battle of \"\"Tapae\"\" which was nothing, just an emlty field, and the roman empire does NOT fight to conquer grass and empty fields) was also lost by the roman army which was totally defeated/anhilated, and even Fuscus died in battle. All these info are correct and o  your/that page. Accepted by you as administrator.\n",

      "It's a retorical question.\n",
      "I am a pretty known international history investigator, and my coleagues often make fun of the wikipedia trolls which poses as administrators. I mean.. the facts speak for themselfs. You change Dacian victories in \"\"indecisive battle\"\", and indecisive battles in \"\"roman victory\"\", which makes you automaticaly bias, and history falsifier, obviously in favour of the invading hoodlam romans. \n",
      "You go so far in presenting the invading (into Dacian teritories) romans as \"\"the good guys\"\" and the Dacians as \"\"bad guys\"\", that you even post totally ridiculous texts like \"\"the Dacians invaded Dacia, and the romans (coming beligerantly all the way from Italy) were right to punishe the Dacians for that\"\"😉.\n",
      "How criminal are you?\n",
      "About you history knowlwdge (if any) is pointless to ask. Right?\n",

That's not reliable. There are studies presented by outright bigots. That's not reliable. There are studies that claim to show one thing, but do not. That's not reliable. The organizations in the article, which have membership in the hundreds of thousands of scientists and researchers around the world, are not unreliable nor do they present subjectively biased conclusions based on what they studied. Pointing out a difference, for example, of a male child of two lesbians not being as aggressive as the male child of a man and woman is very trivial. The conclusions that the scientific world has come to is that, while there may be some isolated differences, which exist in all types of families not just those with same-sex parents, it is inconceivable to make the generalization that one is better or more efficient than the other. The only contrasts which my have significant differences are those families who do not have two parents, no matter their gender.

      "HI. I've appreciated your responses on this topic, but these   have been difficult for me to understand. I'm thinking that perhaps my confusion stems from argument(s) I've heard that \"\"physics is local\"\" which might mean limiting inertial reference frames to specific and very localized lattices? I ask because I do think of these frames as extending uniformly to infinity, and I cannot think of a proper reference frame lattice varying over distances in any significant way. Another possible source of confusion (I don't know if this is the case, but as I said I'm at a lost to understand your reply) is perhaps you are thinking Hubble's law isn't uniform when AFAIK is supposed to involve a spatially uniform expansion (observers in different parts of the observable universe should be currently observing basically the same distant red shifts and law).     \"\n",

      "After having a look at the articles in question, I am even more convinced that these are very dubious references. The SMH article is actually a secondary source, with the quote in question coming from tipping.com, which is an American website. I visited tipping.com and I can't even find the quote as it was used in the SMH story, suggesting that they may have changed their minds in the last couple of years! The other article by USA Today seems to be more compelling (suggesting a 10 - 12% tip for Australian restaurants but no tip for other services), but again doesn't correlate with my experiences. As mentioned above, I worry about the quality of the research in the article, because it clearly says that New Zealand has no tipping, and yet seems to think that Australia (which is just over the way from NZ) has a totally different tipping custom. My experience has been that this is not the case, and I would think that the tipping custom that applies in NZ applies equally in Australia.\n",

      " Second time of asking: do you know which player is being wrongly attributed by Bluemoon with the goal that James claims in his book Tommy Booth scored in the Anglo-Scottish cup game against Sheffield United? Can you also give me the page reference so that I can include it in a footnote?  I would also like a page reference for the Honved UCWC cup tie team line-up so I can include that in the footnote I've already written which you need to validate against James and let me know that you agree with it. I got a little ahead of myself in writing that particular footnote. I claim in it that James has Book playing in the game with Booth taking no part in the match. I happen to know that to be true because I saw City play every home game that season. That obviously doesn't help me with the away fixture at Honved but I definitely do remember him being out during one of his main seasons during the period I was a regular in the Kippax due to his having an operation on his knee to fix his cruciate ligament. Booth, Doyle and Oakes were almost regular fixtures in the team at that time, playing every game, so his absence from that mighty midfield triumvirate (and Heslop taking over the CH role) is something that I do still remember 45 years later, although until this issue came up to jog my memory I would not have been able to pin it down to the autumn of 1970. I'm surprised I even recall it after so long a period, but Google is your friend once you know what you are looking for, so I have now found a few articles out there that prove he could not possibly have played in that game. But that's all by-the-by; the footnote isn't about my own uncitable knowledge and fond memories. It addresses what Bluemoon states versus what James states in the book, and I have no idea what James states until you tell me. But if it is not in line with what I have already written then we have a big problem! Finally, to round things out, could you also send me a page reference for \"\"Der Bomber\"\"'s appearance in the Barnet game and I'll add that to his footnote in the same manner as I included your page reference for the Coventry City match (which I was also at) in Paul Power's footnote.

Many times it happens that corporate have to shift their employees to different city or country for long term projects. In that case, a hotel cannot give all the amenities which a furnished apartment for corporate can give.  When the executives are relocated to other place it may be for weeks also and months also. So, staying for such a long period in a hotel can be uncomfortable and inconvenient. Now, there are variety of furnished apartments available designed especially for corporate stay. The employees can stay in these furnished apartments having all amenities in the kitchen where they can cook homemade dishes which is not available in a hotel. There is personal washer and dryer in many furnished apartments where you can wash your clothes and don’t have to spend money separately for the laundry.

      "Nowadays, there has been a large increase of temporary relocation of employees. To be away on an unfamiliar place on a business trip is not so easy as it seems to be. As you overcome all the professional challenges, you also have an emotional challenge to overcome while deciding to stay away from home for a longer period. Thus, you need a temporary accommodation which is as comfortable as possible. Staying in a hotel for more than few days can be very expensive for corporates. So, most of the business executives during their visits to different cities or different countries prefer to stay in a short term corporate housing as it is economical as well as beneficial from accommodation point of view. The main aspect in travelling is the accommodation. If the accommodation is good, you will feel comfortable and happy and will be able to achieve your professional goals easily. Short term corporate housing consists of furnished apartments, condominiums, and homes that provide short term accommodations for business executives and people who want to stay on a temporary basis. So, whenever you are going for any business trip or for mini vacation then short term corporate housing rentals is the best option for enjoying the trip.\n",

But a spread-spectrum signal need not be any harder to detect than a narrow-spectrum.  A signal that is transmitted at a very low bitrate may be difficult to detect, but even this is not necessarily true.  In steganography, the message is normally hidden inside another message.  The study of analog, technical ways to transmit signals secretly is not really within the purview of steganography - it includes tricks like line-of-sight infrared lasers, transmissions as short, high data rate bursts, and other esoteric tricks.   05:04, Jan 4, 2005 (UTC)\n",

Based on the fact that a photon has no mass, the equations that are given in the present definition of kinetic energy are not applicable to electromagnetic radiation. I must say I agree with Andries. Also, this article is part of an encyclopedia. Why should it be limited  to the basic definitions of kinetic and potential energy forms and I see no reason why we are trying to associate energy forms as to being only potential or kinetic. I like the work done by Bensaccount, but I think it needs to be elaborated. Electrical energy, for example, has both forms of potential and kinetic energies. According to \"\"Principles of science\"\", 1966, the most common forms of energy are mechanical energy, chemical energy, heat energy, sound energy (compressional waves), light energy (electromagnetic radiation), electrical energy and nuclear energy.

In the former paper (arXive) it occurs at equation (13). In the latter paper (J price) this is clearly stated in the last sentence of the wording beside fig. 5 on page 14 of the pdf file.\n",

In other words, these transformation equations only apply to co-rotating radial motion such as would occur if an object were to be constrained to move in a radial groove on a rotating turntable.\n",

      "You both insist that a circular motion involves a net inward centripetal force. If that were so, the radius would shrink and we wouldn't have a circular motion.\n",

      "You are basing your beliefs in this regard upon the restricted high school derivation of centripetal force in circular motion. The force needed to rotate the velocity vector inwards shows up to be the standard expression for centripetal force. However, if we examine the exact same vector diagram for a straight line motion measured relative to the same origin, we will obtain the exact same expression, only radially outwards. The centripetal force in circular motion is therefore merely cancelling with the centrifugal force. This fact is totally overlooked in high school physics courses.\n",

      "You must never lose track of the physical meaning behind the maths symbols which you use. These transformation equations cannot be applied to a particle which is stationary in the inertial frame. The entire derivation of those equations is based on the actual components of its actual acceleration. One component leads to the Coriolis force and the other component leads to the centrifugal force. If there is no actual acceleration, then these two components will both be either zero, or equal and opposite. There will be no net inward centripetal force no matter what frame of reference we view it from.\n",

      "As regards the merry-go-round example, it actually undermines your point and bolsters the very point that I have been trying to make. The quote The radial Coriolis force associated with azimuthal motion is much like an increase or slackening of the centrifugal force tends to confirm my view that the so-called radial Coriolis force is in fact a centrifugal force and that in meteorology it would invoke Archimedes' principle and invoke a torque on a cyclone, due to differential centrifugal force on the east-west wind at one side, and the west-east wind at the other side.\n",

Also sinhalese power was very weak at that time due to regular providing of strong armies to assist Pandyan to servile from Cholas. Due to this Veera Pandyan a Pandyan prince who get help from Sinhalese and couldn't servive chola powers invaded weak (unstable due to internal conflicts for kingship) Pollonnaruwa. Then Kalinga Magha (Sinha) invaded Rajarata with army of Tamils. There was a battle Magha defeated Veera Pandyan. Magha was accepted as the king. But it wasn't sure whether Magha was controlled by his army chiefs. Armies destroyed Buddhist stupas (may be to find treasures). Also there wasn't way to feed large number of army. Therefore they expelled Sinhalese from north.\n",
      "People go against the king (as they did to Mahasen) and fight against king. Magha had to abandon the Rajarata. This army wasn't big as previous chola armies. Previous occasions Rajarata rulers completely expelled previous chola invaders and those who wished to join  king was also allowed ( vellakkara group). But Magha's army had good support from Pandyan (It is not clear why Pandyan betrayed Sinhalese as Sinhalese regularly provided armies to survive from Cholas). Pandyan was just near Jaffna and able to respond very quickly. After repulse of Sinhalese Magha's descenders had to accept they obey Pandyan King. Pandyan ruled/assist jaffna with military family called as Aryachakravarthi. But in 1323 powerful Muslim empire destroyed Pandyan capital and captured the king. After Pandyan was ruled by Muslims. They didn't care to assist Jaffna. At this point Aryachkravarthi him self made as the king of Jaffna. \n",

      " Auto guides and the motoring press are not good sources for an encyclopedia article about \"\"luxury vehicle\"\". This is because automakers feed the press a lot of BS (Boastful Superlatives) who then work hard to write articles adding even more BS to describe their products. The press earns credits from the hands that feed them. Add to this the fact that potential and actual purchasers of luxury vehicles have an insatiable  appetite  for this type of BS. Classifying a particular vehicle as \"\"luxury\"\" is also designed to easily make it superior to other vehicles even if the differences are superficial. Using self-serving BS in marketing claims is a very, very old invention that helps sell products, as well as fuel the fan base with \"\"bragging\"\" rights to which vehicles are \"\"luxury\"\". On the other hand, it is more difficult for most marketers to be humble and genuine. That is why an encyclopedia article has to avoid falling into the trap of using traditional marketing superlatives and hyperbole. —   \"\n",

For most applications of tensors to engineering (e.g., rigid body dynamics and stress analysis), it is not necessary to accommodate the general coordinate systems of tensor calculus.  Usually there is some fixed background frame and at worst one needs to know how things transform when that frame is rotated.  Then raising and lowering of indices is also not required, and all of the tensoriality is essentially quite trivial (so suitable for engineers).  It seems to me that this is the intended scope of the article, but it might be helpful if it stated this plainly somewhere, although it is possible that I might have misunderstood what is meant by \"\"rectangular coordinate system\"\".\n",

I think some time should be devoted to discussing examples.  A good one is the inertia tensor and Sylvester's law, in my opinion, because it's very easy to visualize (for instance, in terms of a spinning plate or something).    \"\n",

The election victory of Hamas in the Gaza-strip allowed the party to rule the power on to the Palestinian people since 2006. Also the Hamas party is doing charity works for the poor, disabled and children.

      "\n",
      "Dear “Lessheard vanU” and to Wikipedia including all editors and administrators & Mr. Wales:   This is a very serious issue.  We contributing writers have attempted to follow wikipedia written polices in contributing and adding to an existing article or creating one.  Yet there are double standards beings upheld by wikipedia’s own editors and administrators.  As with Blackpearl14, who clearly believes that wikipedias polices don’t apply to her, and with other editors who uphold double standards.   Then when challenged to the double standards, including Blackpearl14's violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and reckless authoritarian rule and control, other wikipedia editors and administrators then support each other when one of them continues to violate wikipedia’s own written polices.    “Lessheard vanU” had then wrongly and deliberately calls the contributing people who writes back and flags the issue at hand a “harassing the editor”, outright agreeing with Blackpearl14.  Then in addition to IP address being blocked, all “talk & discussion” are deleted  leaving only one sided bias and reckless claims against the contributing writers.  Even though wrongly deleted by wikipedia editors & administrators, all of this has been recorded, including that Blackpearl14 having repeatedly writing in both correspondence and her bio page (copies have been secure)  that the articles belong to her and they will continue to be own and controlled by her.  These statements alone proves that she is in violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and purpose.  Yet you have ignored that.\n",
      "\n",
      "As previously written in discussion, per wikipedia’s own written polices, but immediately deleted by Blackpearl14 and then sanctioned by  “Lessheard vanU”, Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages, and then recklessly calls anyone who doesn’t follow her bias views vandals, attackers and such.   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedia’s own written polices.  Sorry, but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.   As recorded, Blackpearl14's pages regarding this issue are one sided, not neutral, are bias, in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.   Yes, Pirates of the Caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral, they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company.   Following wikipedia’s own written “neutral” policy, entire articles would have to be deleted.    Yet Blackpearl14 continues to violate Wikipedia polices and purpose.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Then with IP’s being deliberately blocked and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things, if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to Pirates of the Caribbean following wikipedia’s own written polices, editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason, to delete those articles and ban the IP user.   They use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts.   It’s a total lock out by the editors and administrators, abusing their trust tools, acting like a private monarchy.   To date, Blackpearl14's has proven she has ultimate control, has repeatedly stated that is her purpose, and had even sought to have the articles locked.    Then you “Lessheard vanU” wrote that you don’t want to lock these articles, stating it goes against company policy, but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as “vandals” and “harassing the editors” etc...\n",

      "Relating to  (and let me be honest, I'm not up for a protracted debate, I'm just here to offer a perspective that you are free to ignore).  The problem is how you phrased the issue.  If you are claiming admin abuse, you need to be specific.  If you are claiming it is no longer needed, then your opinion of PBS's original ban is irrelevant.  When it comes to General Sanctions, admin are given broad and sweeping authority, because the community wanted them to have a hammer to deal with problems.  Whether you deserved it or not, I have no idea, I didn't do that research and don't have time.  I'm talking about procedure here.  Kosh's comments just muddied the waters, unquestionably admin have the authority to do moratoriums and the like on these articles under General Sanctions, and do topic bans.  Authority isn't debatable because it is clearly spelled out in policy, so Kosh ended up making it less likely others would participate when debating something that is clearly not debatable, and PBS was on topic in addressing those points.  Your points got lost in the mix.  It happens.  And Dougweller and RGloucester also piped in, it wasn't just one person.  It was just one person taking your side, but he was mistaken on the procedural points.  Even DGG jumped in to support the moratorium, and he isn't prone to jump into fires.  Then Obsidi joined the fray.  So 5 people participated, besides yourself, not just one. The problem being that you guys debated the right of the admin to impose sanctions (and he clearly has the right), instead of the circumstances of your situation, which is why 80% of the people disagreed with you and Kosh. You complain that only one admin has spoken, but that isn't true.  Obviously, PBS is an admin, but so is Dougweller and DGG, neither of which has a reputation for being heavy handed.  Quite the opposite, actually.  In reality, he could have put a one year moratorium on name changes and it would have been 100% supported in policy, but he chose a very short and reasonable period.  You might not LIKE it, but the community voted specifically to give admin that power.  If you had not muddied the discussion up by mixing both issues, your topic ban and his authority to issue a moratorium, you would have had a better chance, although odds are that the topic ban would have stuck because there wasn't any abuse in his doing so that I could see.  It was his judgement.  Disagreeing with it doesn't make it abuse. And the fact that it was only three months....that is the shortest topic ban I've ever seen, so obviously he wasn't trying to be heavy handed.  Sometimes, you just have to accept that you don't have a case, and this one could easily be closed as \"\"no consensus to make any changes to existing sanctions\"\".  Again, I'm not up for debating, but I could care less about these articles, and if you want an honest review from an experienced admin, you just read it.  - 2¢ \"\n",

They also understand that trends have beginnings.  It is simply meaningless to say \"\"the old definition is incorrect.\"\"  If you do not understand why, I urge you to read up on the philosophy of science - definitions are more or less useful.

In the United States, at least, you are dead wrong.  If you are not from the US let me tell you, there is a huge \"\"creationist\"\" movement which has, on numerous ocassions, had the theory of evolution banned from high schools.

We should no longer teach evolution!\"\"  Obviously, they misunderstand the way science works.  They do not understand that scientists refine and develop theories without necessarily rejecting them.

      "“My attempts to demonstrate evolution by an experiment carried on for more than 40 years have completely failed. It is not even possible to make a caricature of an evolution out of paleobiological facts. The idea of an evolution rests on pure belief”. (Nils Heribert Nilsson, noted Swedish botanist and geneticist, of Lund University and evolutionist).\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think in fifty years, Darwinian evolution will be gone from the science curriculum. I think people will look back on it and ask how anyone could, in their right mind, have believed this, because it's so implausible when you look at the evidence”. (Johnathan Wells, 'Icons of Evolution').\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have come to the conclusion that Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory, but a metaphysical research program”. (Karl Popper, German born philosopher of science, called by Nobel Prize winner Peter Medawar, 'Incomparably the greatest philosopher of science who has ever lived').\n",
      "\n",
      "“Scientists who go about teaching that evolution is a fact of life are great con-men, and the story they are telling may be the greatest hoax ever! In explaining evolution we do not have one iota of fact”. (Newton Tahmisian, Atomic Energy Commission).\n",
      "\n",
      "“The pathetic thing about it is that many scientists are trying to prove the doctrine of evolution, which no science can do”. (Robert A. Milikan, physicist by provision and a Nobel Prize winner, speech before the American Chemical Society).\n",
      "\n",
      "“The miracles required to make evolution feasible are far greater in number and far harder to believe than the miracle of creation”. (Richard Bliss, former professor of biology and science education as Christian Heritage College, ‘It Takes a Miracle for Evolution).\n",
      "\n",
      "“The only competing explanation for the order we all see in the biological world is the notion of special creation”. (Colin Patterson, evolutionist and senior Paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History, which houses more than 60.000.000 fossils).\n",
      "\n",
      "“Evolution is a fairy tale for grown ups. This theory has helped nothing in the progress of science. It is useless”. (Prof. Louis Bounoure, Director of Research, National Center of Scientific Research).\n",
      "\n",
      "“All of us who study the origin of life find that the more we look into it, the more we feel it is too complex to have evolved anywhere. We all believe as an article of faith that life evolved from dead matter on this planet. It is just that life’s complexity is so great, it is hard for us to imagine that it did”. (Dr. Harold Urey, Nobel Prize winner).\n",
      "\n",
      "“A growing number of respectable scientists are defecting from the evolutionist camp, moreover, for the most part these ‘Experts’ have abandoned Darwinism, not on the basis of religious faith or biblical persuasions, but on strictly scientific grounds, and in some instances, regretfully”. (Dr. Wolfgang Smith, physicist and mathematician).\n",
      "\n",
      "“The evolution theory is purely the product of the imagination”. (Dr. Ambrose Flemming, Pres. Philosophical Society of United Kingdom).\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have always been slightly suspicious of the theory of evolution because of its ability to account for any property of living beings. I have therefore tried to see whether biological discoveries over the last thirty years or so fit in with Darwin’s theory. I do not think that they do. To my mind, the theory does not stand up at all”. (H. Lipson, “A Physicist Looks at Evolution“, Physic Bulletin, Page 138).\n",
      "\n",
      "“The talk of evolution is sheer nonsense not founded on observation and wholly unsupported by fact. This Museum is full of proof of the utter falsity of their view”. (Niles Ethredge, British Museum of Science).\n",

      "“(Evolution is) a great cosmologic myth of the twentieth century”. (Michael Denton, molecular biochemist, ‘Evolution, Theory in Crisis’).\n",
      "\n",
      "“The evolutionary establishment fears creation science, because evolution itself crumbles when challenged by evidence. In the 1970s and 1980s, hundreds of public debates were arranged between evolutionary scientists and creation scientists. The latter scored resounding victories, with the result that, today, few evolutionists will debate. Isaac Asimov, Stephen Jay Gould, and the late Carl Sagan, while highly critical of creationism, all declined to debate”.

But as to that you'd be well advised to consult an editor with a track record in science/mathematics articles. Meanwhile, thank you so much for educating me about that very great man Maxwell.\n",

I've already started working on this article: History of Sesame Street, and if you look at the reference section, you'll see that I've used your book extensively.

See, I'm turning 45 this year, which makes me old enough to be the first audience that watched it.  I had to put the book down to compose myself when I realized, \"\"They did all that for me!\"\"  I appreciate learning about the struggles they all went through to affect my life so profoundly, and now the life of my own children, who are severely developmentally disabled and love the show as much as I did and still do.  I believe that Sesame Street deserves high quality articles on Wikipedia, and I've taken it upon myself to help accomplish that.

What's more, the image in the infobox comes to us from the self-published book of a Holocaust denier - although it was uploaded, I presume, in good-faith - who cannot claim PD for the images, but (as he does) only for the text. I presume the PD release for the text is there to help him popularize such nonsense (\"\"read me, copy me\"\"), but the images are still copyrighted by their original authors, from whom the author took his images without proper credit. Unless I see some serious arguments as to why to keep the images, sometime in the near future, I myself will visit wikicommons with a couple of deletion requests.

They are some Chinese pages using this character in the context of referring to the Japanese Labor ministry. I don't count that as reverse importation. IMHO, the statement in the article about reverse importation is incorrect.\n",

Also, the site points out frequently on the fact of \"\"quality over quantity\"\" of a side of the argument, and that not all sides of an argument have equal weight.

Like today, I was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the 5th Circuit had a more pro se friendly tone, which I think is because of Judge Learned Hand, who was in the fifth circuit. And the only reason I know about that is that one time I went in every federal circuit and searched on the words \"\"pro se\"\" in the 40s because I was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se (No, there was not).

      "Dear Jimbo, I posted something here and it was archived because it was viewed that after a 3 day ban I was too expert in the use of WP:XXXX rules to be a newbie. It was said \"\"Will be archived: If you ever want to return, Jimbo can discuss this message (and your ADMINISTRATORS comment below) from his talk-page archives.\"\" I don't even know what that means. Here is my reply to the person that said that. And then the thing that was archived. The longer article was deleted off the page I put it on. I will glance back at my talk page to see if you have anything to say on this matter. If not I understand that it is not your issue. I would though prefer if you looked at it since that was my point, that people in power beneath you seem to want to bite the newbie to the point that the newbie is leaving and not coming back. They even suggested that my issue was with the WP:3RR rule which was not the issue. As a newbie I didn't know about that, and learned my lesson. It was with the time on the talk page being attacked by a WP:GANG / WP:TAGTEAM which are supported by administrators. So the person who archived my comments of your talk page didn't even get the point. Once I was told of the WP:3RR rule I never even touched the article again.

So while it might be hard for you to believe that someone can read in 3 days a bunch of WP:XXXX rules, it is not impossible. Actually I didn't have to read many, just the ones that were used against me to have me blocked. As I found, they were being totally misquoted against me. So yeah, you might find it hard to believe, you might also want to go to the Alkaline Diet article and look at how many people said exactly the same thing as I did in the past on the article. Is that hard to believe? Don't bother answering, just know that you might want to look at the history and deal with it. I don't understand why this was taken off Jimbo Wales' page by someone other than him with a note hard to believe. Isn't that his choice? Yes I would like him to discuss it with me. As I put it on his page with the express comment that the people (like you) who are in between him and me are the problem. So you making a personal judgement that someone can't read a few Wiki WP:XXXX rules in 3 days gives you the right to ignore my very detailed comments.

I can't know what is and what is not of interest to you, and following WP:BOLD I am making my statement and you can decide what to do next.

The fact that the area is a suburban part of the Tucson metro area has some informative value for our readers as it suggests the kind of connection it has to the city of Tucson, and informs our readers of the nature of the area = that it is a residential area, not a downtown business area, not the countryside, not an inner city area, etc.  \"\"Unincorporated\"\" as you added to the daughter article is a political distinction and similarly not particularly informative in the context of this article.   The wikilinked article on Casas Adobes refers to it as being suburban, as well. So, I am taking it out of the lead where it is not needed and putting into the body where it has some value.

      "\n",
      "\"\"British anti-Catholicism has a long history going back five centuries and reaching the highest levels of British government. It began in the early 16th century when King Henry VIII failed to receive an annulment from the Vatican and subsequently broke English Christianity away from the pope and declared himself the absolute spiritual ruler of the Church of England. He then proceeded on a campaign to persecute and murder all who opposed his personal claim to the \"\"English papacy.\"\" Things only went downhill from there. In subsequent generations the throne passed between Catholic and Protestant heirs, each persecuting their political enemies. The final result came under Queen Elizabeth I which settled England as a Protestant country. In the following centuries, England became the leading herald of anti-Catholic propaganda around the world, as the British crown persecuted Irish Catholics and waged war against the Catholic kingdoms of France and Spain.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"Sadly, the more things change the more they stay the same. The world may have moved into the 21st century, but British politics is still locked in the 16th century. To date Catholics are still forbidden from the British royal family. Government officials still mock the pope and the Church behind closed doors. Leading party officials not only refuse to defend the pope's right of innocence until proven guilty, but actually participate in promoting anti-Catholic presumption. Way to go England! Thanks for reminding the world just how little you've progressed in five centuries. Just brilliant! Jolly good show!\"\" Malke2010 \"\n",

How do we know he doesn't have a lifespan of over a hundred years. He has certainly lived for more than that long even if he has been killed on the odd occasion. He had already lived for a century or more in Wind Waker. Furthermore I think Kaiju is debatable. The term Kaiju is Japanese for \"\"strange beast\"\" and as Ganon is indeed a strange fictional beast of Japanese origins he could be classed as a Kaiju. The Kaiju category is pretty much the same as the Fictional monsters category but it can also encompass creatures in mythology as well as fiction so by those standards I think the Loch Ness Monster and the classic European Dragon could be classed as Kaiju.   \"\n",

      "Were Michael's mind open to rational persuasion, he would have yielded on this long before. His objection is, at this point, ideological. More examples will not convince him.  That we all get things wrong at times is easy to see. What is more difficult to understand is why we get things wrong, and why we persist in error.  On the Israeli/Jewish side of this common problem, there are two elements, one cultural, one a matter of the politics of image-forging to win a global consensus by affecting the way events and history are perceived. I think Michael's error is to be classified in the former, which is basically rooted in a long tradition of thinking in terms of Jewish exceptionalism, and therefore any analogies that may arise from the kind of descriptive language used to characterise Palestinian realities that might remind one of similar Jewish realities, is repressed. Michael dislikes 'uprising' because there is the possibility that it might create a subliminal nexus with the Warsaw uprising. There is a deeper analogy. The Romans crushed Bar Kochba's revolt (which in the historical literature is often described as an 'uprising'), and under Hadrian set out to Romanize Judea. The creation of Israel vindicates Bar Kochba, but also, in rejudaising Palestine, creates an implicit structural analogy between the fanatic resistance of Bar Kochba, and the PLO/Hamas/the Al-Aqsa type violence, esp.sacred violence in the name of national restoration. This analogy is naturally repugnant to a cast of mind rooted in the myths of Jewish exceptionalism, since those who evoke the myth of Masada must at the same time war down a native people who are battling from the redoubts of their rocky bantustans against the judaisation of their native and sacred territory, very much as Bar Kochba himself did. Rabbinical schools after the failure of Bar Kochba developed a doctrine of submission to foreign states, one which lasted until the creation of Israel redeemed the earlier foundational myths of the Book of Joshua, and dispelled cringing by recurring to the heroic militancy of the first invasion of Canaan. Ironically, what is expected of Palestinians is that they cringe before the power of Israel's occupation: any phenomenon bearing a generic resemblance to the sicarii, or zealotism, is dismissed as an appalling 'Arab cultural trait': though in fact it resonates, mutatis mutandis, with analogies from Jewish history under the Roman empire from Titus to Hadrian, where militant fanaticism and zealotism in the name of national autonomy flourished. The early Zionists from Jabotinsky to Ben-Gurion to Moshe Dayan and Menachem Begin were perfectly aware that their policies bore these ironic resonances.  Being thorough realists, they didn't have to kid themselves. Today we live in the fog of public opinion myths, where these ironical analogies are elided from consciousness. People are raised on the standard clichés, endlessly recycled by hasbara machines, and underwrite them sincerely, because they no longer have much of a sense of history. Much could be said of this. But this is not the place.Regards\n",

If families start communicating with their children, helping their children, and supporting the things their children accomplish, there will be a smaller amount of gang members.

Considering the historical effect in least the concept he claimed to be god I think may make it relevant here, but I could see taking it off as disputed. Although if you want to get into it in many books I've read indicate Hong Xiuquan did not claim to be God either. He believed that Jesus was the Son of God, but not God. He had an Arian view of Jesus and of his own role as \"\"Son of God.\"\" Although I added her it sounds possible that this MITA woman only believed she contained the Holy Spirit rather then \"\"was the Holy Spirit.\"\" Yet you don't object on those or ones that may even be more debatable.

The distintion is that people, act differently under a veil of anonimity, which is what the monikers are for. If I had known in the beginning of the WP experience, that exchanges among monikers can create hostile environments, I may have not used a moniker (though I did try to use my real name and it was rejected). Another issue, is that defenses I have (there are a few that I don't), are so far in the past, and require due diligence, that I'm sure no one would want to take the time to research them. Also, there have been many exchanges that led to responses, that were being resopnded to, only to have a block or ban already in place, when I went to save the response. The truth of the matter is that I am guilty of poor reactions in the past, but my reactions had some justification to them. Perhaps the one that stands out the most, was when Ramiro Martinez' page, allowed his vanity publication to stand in the article, which helps him sell books, where an audio history I had of McCoy, was not allowed to stand, which would possibly have helped McCoy as well. It was the double standard that caused the spiraling down of the conversation. Again, I believe the moniker scenario should go, as Sanger tried to deny the moniker system before his departure. It would make WP a better environment, without agenda seeking socks and monikers. Just my opinion, and everyone else I talk to. Thanks for the reply. 64.134.6.107\n",

Without conducting a scientific survey, I would say that x and χ for initial /r/ and intervocalic /rr/ are restricted to poorly educated speakers from the city of Rio de Janeiro and its surroundings, while the media and all reasonably educated speakers there are actually notorious for their use of [ʁ]. Analogously, [h] confines itself to the Centro Oeste, a large but sparsely populated region, and, again, to uneducated speakers.\n",

This article contains plenty of insulting and disparaging remarks about Ali Sina made by Muslims who called him “Islamophobe”, “a rabid anti-Islamic zealot”, \"\"mischievous liar\"\", a man running a “well organized campaign of hate and deceit”, who is “re-hashing polemic orientalist material”.  All this is okay because they vilify Sina. But no one is allowed to posts a single comment made by someone who is on his side. Is this article created to bash the man or tell both sides of the story without taking side? With this much disparaging comments about Sina, where is the positive comment about him? Now I am going to put back the comment and please do not remove it until others have their say too. We already know where you stand and how much you hate Sina. Let others speak too please.

In the \"\"Dragonlance Legends\"\" series (Weis and Hickman) R goes back in time to learn the rest of F's secrets, and they have a magic battle. While the victor is considered to be R, and goes by R, he actually possesses the memories/abilities of both, and they both had the desire to become a god by destroying Takhisis,  so it is unclear which one actually survived the battle. So, with the lack of clear evidence, it is a Schrodinger's Cat situation. By which I mean that, from that point in the storyline, R can be seen as both R AND F, even though they started out as two different people.

My point is that objective or not, fair or not, truthful or not, this mediation imho will not solve the issue. It is divided for a reason and that's because both sides have facts that support their views. Like a split decision prize fight if you get 50 fair judges you will still have a judgment that is all over the place, maybe even 25-25. I don't recall where but I believe it was said that by \"\"agreeing\"\" we agree to accept this new resolution.

Dr. Lee movingly testified to messages\"\", \"\"...the fiery and explosive work of the Holy Spirit...\"\", \"\"Blind eyes were opened to see and ears that could not hear came to hear\"\" - those are a very few examples of utterly inappropriate and unencyclopedic phrases that abound in this text.  Add to this the fact that this article seems to make the claim that Lee can actually perform miracles of healing, in direct contravention of Wikipedia policies.  In addition, criticism and counter arguments have been removed or whitewashed, sometimes to the point of saying the exact opposite of what the sources state.\n",

If more detail is needed/warrented, provide a link to the 'main article'.  Obviously this is also affected by the significance of the character.  Starman (comics) for instance gives descriptions of all of the many characters with that name, but only re-links to those individuals who have been notable using that psuedonym.  For Shadowhawk it seems as if the mantle of this character was passed cleanly from one person to another, so I'd say keep it all in one article as with articles such as Phantom Lady or Black Canary.\n",

      "populism as a positive term, and a critique of critics\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I wrote last fall, several notable developments in the scholarship and discussion of populism have occurred. The South African intellectual and scholar Xolela Mangcu has entered the global discussion, building on a highly visible lecture he gave in Cape Town for the Wolpe Trust last June 18, \"\"Jacob Zuma on the Politics of Grievance\"\" (http://www.wolpetrust.org.za/dialogue2007/mangcupaper.pdf ). In this lecture Mangcu takes issue with what he sees as the discussions of \"\"populism\"\" that caricature its meanings and history as simply a rhetorical stance or politics of popular grievance against elites. He developed this argument in his weekly column in Business Day December 7, 2007, drawing on Gianna Pomata's scholarship on the history of populism in Europe  and her treatment of populist critics as part of an intellectual tradition of \"\"Enlightenment rationalism\"\" and growing separation of of popular and elite intellectual cultures. He also makes  a number of parallels with South African journalists and scholars whom he believes treat populism in very superficial ways. . Mangcu also develops these arguments in his forthcoming book, To the Brink (Universityof Kwa Xulu Natal, 2008), sure to create a major discussion in African academic and intellectual circles since he is widely described as the main intellectual heir to Steve Biko, the founder of the Black Consciousness Movement. FOr an excerpt of his forthcoming book see http://book.co.za/bookchat/topic.php?id=2079\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as Mike Huckabee's \"\"populism\"\" is concerned, the piece by David Kirkpatrick in the New York Times January 13, 2008 (\"\"Young Evangelicals Embrace Huckabee\"\") has a detailed discussion of why many Catholics and evangelicals see him as populist. The article, among many in the American election season, is shows the strikingly difference valence of populism in the US and Europe. In the US the term, on balance, clearly has positive associations  otherwise major candidates like Edwards and Huckabee would not use it in self-description. This is  a product, most likely, of the much greater public awareness of the history of democratic movements like the 19th century farmers' cooperatives, New Deal reform, and the black freedom strucggle as broadly populist.

Careful examination of the tower shows a basically exponential shape; actually two different exponentials, the lower section overdesigned to ensure resistance to wind forces. Several mathmatical explanations have been proposed over the years; the most recent is described as a nonlinear integral equation based on counterbalancing the wind pressure on any point on the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point. As a demonstration of the tower's effectiveness in wind resistance, it sways only 6–7 cm (2–3 in) in the wind.\n",

Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.\n",
      "During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book \"\"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia\"\", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that \"\"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek\"\" .\n",
      "\n",
      "The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.\n",
      "\n",
      "On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses and places of worship were burned down or destroyed. Furthermore, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region who took refuge in the Republic of Albania.\n",

I'm going to leave editing for others, as it's proven futile for me to try to improve the article with my own edits. I'll focus instead on helping Ling.Nut get his new lede implemented. This version is a huge improvement, and I think is coming together quite nicely. I have a few further objections/suggestions:\n",

      "1) \"\"These territorial gains left Israel three and half times larger than its original size...\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I strongly object to this wording. This suggests Israel's territory expanded, and the assumption seems to be that there was annexation rather than occupation. Yet it's an uncontroversial point of fact under international law that the acquisition of territory by war is inadmissible, and the Israeli occupation and colonization illegal. This is reflected in UN res 242 and numerous subsequent resolutions. Suggest:\n",
      "\n",
      " \"\"This left Israel in control of three in a half times more territory than it had under the 1949 Armistice Lines.\"\"\n",

      " \"\"Israel rejected proposals to have UNEF restationed on its side of the border.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This is extremely relevant for the context, and particularly with regard to the discussion of whether the war was \"\"preemptive\"\" or not. Had Israel truly feared an Egyptian attack, it could very well have accepted the UNEF buffer, yet it refused. Why? If this fact is not mentioned in the lede, it should at the very least be mentioned in the body of the article in the section on that topic. Forgive me if I overlooked it, but I didn't notice it there scanning through.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) \"\"Though few material facts of the war are in dispute, the motivations and intentions of the national leaders on both sides has been the subject of much speculation and debate.\"\"\n",
      "\n",

You fixation on the claim that Yeshu does not refer to an individual or individuals leaves you in a very difficult spot. It has been your on-going contention that the name \"\"Yeshu\"\" is merely the name used by rabbis for Jesus. However, when you insist that \"\"Yeshu\"\" does not refer to an individual, or demand proof that it does, what you are also demanding is proof that \"\"Jesus\"\" refers to an individual, since it is you that insists \"\"Yeshu\"\"=\"\"Jesus\"\".

There will always be new perspectives and theories, just like in Decline of the Roman Empire, but these are not really revisionistic. Revisionism, strictly speaking, is where you take an established idea and discount it based on new evidence.  Otherwise it is just the normal process of better understanding the many nuances and complexity of history.

He is the one that cheated on her and knocked up PhyHO, and he is the one that made her so confused over and over again in 2009 (and during her marriage to Jack). Hmm i loved Jack & Sharon together in the start. They were amazing, i love Shack and I hope someday they could get another chance, how are they awful? Better then Nick/PhyHO. I've seen every episode of Sharon's for AGES, and out of all these years, the only time i have questioned her is when she went to New Orleans and slept with Adam..ugh that ruined all my Shick fantasies, Ha! I feel so bad for her, at first i was like YAY Victor/Sharon are getting married maybe he really loves her..but then i realized it wasn't for love but for revenge. And WTF is with her & Tucker? NO. Just ...NO. They would not make a good romance. I want Sharon to be single or with Nick. That's it for me lmaoo. I don't really care about Jill anymore tbh. I'm very picky, which is why I don't watch full episodes anymore from SOAPS (other then DOOL, i can enjoy the whole episode of that). OMG i love Sharon Case!! She retweets things on her twitter that are semi-insulting to MAB! LMAO! Like one person said, Sharon you finally get your character back now that MAB is gone.  JLover \n",

      "Again, not that natal women have the same HIV risk as TG/TS women... but rather that the total number of females contracting HIV is the same as the total number of MSM contracting HIV.  Source? http://www.avert.org/usastatg.htm Looking over the data, sorry, I correct my statement.  Being female who only has risky heterosexual sex has the same HIV contraction rate as being a male drug user.  Both total populations are unknown however.  Again, my assertion stands, many TG/TS are not males, and thus are not MSM.  Your own sources state that TG/TS groups are only \"\"considered\"\" \"\"alongside\"\" MSM, not that they actually are MSM.  As to Benji: my statements were made on my own talk page, and were not intended to be neither neutral nor unbiased.  If HFarmer wished to discuss the merits of the argument in this talk page, I would have been more than civil... however, she has consistently sought to put me in the worst situation possible and provoke me into an emotional response.  My assertion has, and always will be \"\"I am not male, thus I am not MSM by definition of the term\"\".  She can argue all she wants until she's blue in the face whether they are included or not in MSM statistics, but that's only making a lighter assertion, \"\"they are included in MSM statistics\"\", however her very own source says that they are not considered MSM, even though they may be included in MSM statistics.  I understand the difficulty in understanding the situation... they're saying they're not, but then treating them as if they are, however the fact still remains, many if not most TS/TG individuals are excluded from MSM by the very definition of the term... \"\"men who have sex with men.\"\"   \"\n",

      "Regarding the writer at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hitler_salute\n",
      "\n",
      "    Mr Barlow is a nutter with an obsession. The history of the salute is now improved in the Roman salute article (which had many previous visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page). The pact between the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not well known, and is also not covered widely on Wikipedia, so it is \"\"covered up\"\" by people and also people often refer to it as the \"\"Nazi-Soviet\"\" pact (as the writer above does) which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid Party (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand \"\"Nazi\"\" and the myth that members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party referred to themselves as \"\"Nazis\"\" (they did not refer to themselves as \"\"Nazis\"\").  Some people (note the writer above) try to evade the point with odd comments such as \"\"It wasn't invented by Wikipedia editors to conceal the word 'socialism'!\"\"  That comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word \"\"Nazi\"\" to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party: The National Socialist German Workers' Party. Not only is that done in the title of the page cited (the Nazi-Soviet pact page) it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the Party never appears nor even the phrase \"\"National Socialist.\"\" The writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand \"\"Nazi\"\" even when discussing the very topic at hand.  The Bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, as noted by Professor Curry. However, as anyone who looks at Dr. Curry's historic photographs of the salute can see, it developed into the same salute as that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Even the writer above concedes Dr. Curry's point that the flag was saluted with a normal military-style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath. The writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the U.S. flag.  It is as if the writer above is conceding the point made. Indeed, the writer seems to concede it with the comment \"\"Anyway, even if the gesture had been the same, so what? It's just a gesture. The Soviets used conventional salutes, does that mean that the US military are Communists because they use the same gesture as the Soviet military!\"\"   It is fascinating how the writer again avoids the actual name \"\"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\"\" and also used the term \"\"Communist\"\" instead of using the term \"\"Socialist.\"\"  The writer then attempts to avoid the issue, which is the origin of the straight-arm salute, and tries to turn the issue into an odd argument about whether the salutes dictated particular dogmas.  Nevertheless, the writer evades the topic that Professor Curry has raised, which is that Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy were  self-proclaimed National Socialists in the USA three decades before the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and Edward's book was an international bestseller, translated into every major language (including German, which Edward spoke and wrote, and where Edward had studied as a young man) and that Edward's dogma inspired \"\"Nationalism\"\" clubs worldwide including in Germany. \n",
      "\n",
      "    Yes, the \"\"Roman salute\"\" page did once contain innaccuracies, and the writer above is to be thanked for conceding that point. But that is no reason for the writer to start going on with his use of the term \"\"conspiracy.\"\" It's just what you get when you have an open encyclopedia! The point is to correct error when you see it, and to not delete those corrections when they are made by people like Dr. Curry.  \n",
      "\n",
      "    The writer above also concedes that he is the Wikipedia editor who \"\"became wiser\"\", by incorporating Professor Curry's discoveries.  The writer is to be thanked for crediting Dr. Curry with making it more widely available. It should be noted that the valuable information that Professor Curry provides is his own discovery.  Dr. Curry has also mentioned that the material about the use of the Roman salute in films derives from an academic article by Martin Winkler. Professor Curry pointed out that Martin Winkler did not realize at the time of Winkler's article that the films were all pre-dated by the use of the salute in the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance.  Dr. Curry has also publicly challenged Martin Winkler to debate these issues.  Professor Curry's discovery that the swastika/hakenkreuz, although an ancient symbol, was sometimes used by the National Socialist German Workers' Party as \"\"S\"\" shapes standing for its \"\"Socialism\"\" is also his own original work. And he is right that other writers have deliberate\n",

      "I support these changes. The key thing here is the placement of the counter-narrative (or call it what you will). This is a defining element of the page and of the story. Let me explain why I think it should have its own section. This page is called \"\"Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident,\"\" not ''Tiananmen Square self-immolation hoax\"\", or \"\"Tiananmen Square staged self-immolation.\"\" That is correct, but at the same time it is the same name that would be used if they were confirmed Falun Gong members. Since the nature of the incident is so crucial to defining the story, and that by default the 'argument' of the piece—that is, the entire way in which the story is known to the world—is through the claim that the individuals were Falun Gong practitioners. There would be no such thing as the \"\"\"\"Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident\"\" if it were not claimed that they were Falun Gong members.  In this situation, making clear that there is a well-founded counter narrative is important. It's not something to stuff away to a side-box or the corner of the article. It should not dominate the page, but it should be as prominent as the other narrative (or more so depending on the evidence and wp:due)—therefore I think placing all of that information in its own section is quite appropriate. The other speculations and disputations about the identity of the people and so forth (the parts that are not strictly evidence-based) are separate to this arc. This is my opinion, I apologise for the laborious way I communicated it. I think it is a joke to dispute Pan's investigation. That's the most solid piece of evidence available in the whole thing. Most of the rest is just image-making, speculation, video cuts, and propaganda and counter-propaganda. —Zujine|talk \"\n",

The Fallon citation isn't sourced to Fallon: it's found in multiple sources that make that claim.  Take a look at the citation in the Hippie article: Perry 2005, p. 19; Sinclair, Mick.

It is already being forgotten by all but those who want to sensationalise it into something it is notm i.e. significant.  It is well covered in the construction article in the history section.  The video is not verified as authentic.  I've seen it, and it appears to be highly edited, which could drastically affect its authenticity.  Jagex has acknowledged and fixed the problem.  The coincidence that it happened on a specific date is just that, coincidence.  No one but the vandals who keep changing the article calls it the 666 massacre.  That's just silly.  Get over it and let it go.  It is not significant to RuneScape or to anyone over the age of 14.\n",

Because there's no article on the HD, we shouldn't have its infobox anywhere at all.  Granted, we shouldn't have a stub for the sole purpose of filling a hole, but we also shouldn't pretend that another article fills that hole either.    \n",
      "\n",
      "You are partially correct in your assertion made in the edit summary for the Wade Park article - the park isn't the entire district, but you are also partially incorrect. You're saying: The park itself is not the district, and the National Register database indicates that the park isn't even part of the district  where that I underlined is where you're erring.  The NRHP website lists this: Roughly bounded by E. 105 St., East Blvd., Chester and Euclid Aves. , Cleveland'' (650 acres, 7 buildings, 1 structure)'http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/natregsearchresult.do?fullresult=true&recordid;=339http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/oh/Cuyahoga/districts.html Unless we are looking at different NRHP websites, and you haven't either spent time in Cleveland or ,at the very least, looked at trhe area in question on the map, then you're not taking into account two three things: 1) the 650 acres includes Wade Park (Google Map it). 2) The name Wade Park District explicitly (and even implicitly if you're familiar firsthand with the history of Cleveland). 3) (and this is related to my second point regarding a familiarity with the history of Cleveland) Jeptha Wade's property, which is where Wade Park is and the heart of the district in question, was the seed from where all the buildings in the district sprung from. The CMA, Botanical Gardens, Natural History Museum and Severance Hall, which all are part of the district, would not be there if Wade Park wasn't set aside to be the cultural epicenter that garnered it's NRHP entry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, given that any one of the buildings listed on the registry are technically part of the WPHD, there would be no false information by including the NRHP infobox on any of those articles  which was my entire point of putting it on the CMA article in the first place. The infobox being clearly labelled as Wade Park District''' is not misleading by including it on a building that is part of the district. We could argue about this ad nauseam. But what's the point?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I can make an entire article that covers the district specifically. But why just regurgitate the same stuff found in each individual Wikipedia article that exists for every building that is in the HD (including the Wade Park itself)? Bandwdith pollution notwithstanding, it is simply redundant. Or we could make it less redundant by simply putting the infobox in one of the articles already out there... and the Wade Park article being the namesake for the HD would make the most sense (the article is hardly complete, and could be expanded to include an entire section specifically about the HD and relationship bewteen the two)... and if not that article than the CMA which is the largest building in the HD, and the reason I put it there in the first. Either way, the underlying question in this argument that I have for you is this: how is it productive in our task as Wikipedians, and moreover as members of Ohio-specific Wikprojects, to keep adding and removing factual info from articles with direct relationships to the subject of our debate? Are we trying to make Wikpedia a more informative user-based encyclopedia, or are we nitpicking over how to make a piece of factual information, that is an important part of a large US City, available to those who are looking at Wikipedia for information?\n",

I'm contacting you because you're listed as a resident of San Francisco, and we're currently looking for a friendly Wikipedian to teach students in a University of San Francisco class how to use/edit Wikipedia. This is a role titled the \"\"Wikipedia Campus Ambassador,\"\" and you'll basically be doing in-class presentations about Wikipedia, running Wikipedia labs/workshops, and in general providing face-to-face Wikipedia help for the professor and the students in the class. The time commitment is about 3-5 hours a week (with variations throughout the semester), and for this particular University of San Francisco class, most of the workload will be between March and May. \n",

      "Your edits to the Hermetic Qabbalah page are really quite over the top. Firstly, it is policy not to make a whole series of small edits but to make as few as possible. It makes it very hard to follow the changes when you make a lot of small edits one after the other. Please try to abide by this in the future. While I will agree that this article needs more referencing, most of the things which you have added fact tags to are so well known as to be beyond dispute. Having said this I will be adding some appropriate references in the next day or so. However some things, e.g. Hermetic Qabbalah being a precursor to Wicca etc are not (as you say) bold statements but rather established fact. Also removing all the categories is not fixing 'overcategorization'. I'll agree that one or two of them were a bit spurious, but certainly not all of them. Please take a couple of deep breaths and think carefully before editing pages when you are obviously not well versed in the  topic.\n",

Even in that case, opinion of the majority is still OPINION, not fact.\"\" Fair enough, but later on you say \"\"it's been stated many times that the Americans were only thinking of saving American lives through the A-Bomb. The Japanese never came into it. They did not care at all about Japanese lives, so your reasoning is invalid.\"\" Who said this? You impose such high criteria for my statement that the A-Bomb saved human lives, requiring experts from all over the world, but soon after you baldly assert that my reasoning is invalid because \"\"it's been stated many times...\"\" Stated many times by who?

At the same time, the internet is bulging at the seams with information showing that Detroit is where Techno was birthed. Certainly, Europe has adopted Techno as it's own, more than America or even Detroit ever has or did, but unless we can get some REAL citations going we need to remove, what I see as, the wishful editing claims that Techno began in Western Europe. We REQUIRE citations. I'm honestly pretty neutral in this, I enjoy techno, but I prefer other genres. I just happened to stumble across the article, read the first sentence and checked the \"\"citation\"\" for the Western Europe claim (as it was news to me) and was sent to a dead page. I searched \"\"techno origins\"\" and found numerous pages saying Detroit birthed techno and added those cites. The evidence is just flat out contradictory to what some editors (wish to) believe. Honestly I do not care, but if Wikipedia is to be a reliable source, we as a community must be honest with what the facts are, or provide evidence (in citations) for alternate claims.

Almost no one is familiar with the name Acer floridanum, and despite the fact that recent publications suggest that Acer floridanum might be preferable (the conclusion of that paper wasn't entirely confident as I recall), it's a bit premature to be moving it. Aside from the one publication in a relatively unimportant botanical journal, there isn't much supporting the name. It's not considered accepted by the vast majority of sources (including ITIS, which I think is our standard). Besides, the taxonomy of the species is simply too volatile to be moving it around. DNA work could reveal tomorrow that it's a variety of sugar maple. It's best to wait until a name is more or less universally accepted.

      " Extend Andreasegde's Triangular Diplomacy II solution from 2011! Before  anybody freaks-out, please read the rest. This solution  would continue to promote the usage of pronoun references to band names, mid-sentence while still retaining the ability to occasionally use the band's name or individual member references, mid-sentence. Complaints about the usage of all pronouns making boring, repetitive, prose in the article would be addressed by  adding this addendum to the previous Triangular Diplomacy II solution, already observed by many.\n",

      " When referring to band members,  a lowercase \"\"t\"\" should be used ie. \"\"the Beatles\"\",\n",
      " when referring to the band, as a corporate whole,  an uppercase \"\"T\"\" should be used. ie. \"\"The Beatles\"\".\n",
      "\n",
      " Some Examples:\n",
      " \"\"The Beatles were a rock band of great accomplishment.\"\" = capitalisation is always used at the beginning of a sentence, regardless.\n",
      " \"\"Paul became a Beatle\"\" = obvious individual (non-group) reference, no \"\"the\"\" or identifying phrase needed.\n",
      " \"\"Paul became one of the most popular members of The Beatles band\"\" = whole group reference with \"\"band\"\" identifier and also obvious context.\n",
      " \"\"Paul became one of most long-lived members of The Beatles band\"\" = group reference with \"\"band\"\" identifier and obvious context.\n",
      " \"\"George Martin became involved with The Beatles group later.\"\" = \"\"group\"\" clarifies corporate group usage meaning.\n",
      " \"\"After the event the individual Beatles went separate  ways\"\" = \"\"individual\"\" clarifies individual member context.\n",
      " \"\"After the event the Beatles individuals went separate  ways\"\" = \"\"individuals\"\" clarifies.\n",
      " \"\"After the event The Beatles members went separate  ways\"\" = members clarifies the band/group. (a gotcha').\n",
      " If people have other extreme examples, perhaps we can see them in order to fine tune and clarify to satisfy almost all collaborative editors.\n",
      "This solution could resolve most of the concerns stated in this medcom proceding. Future editing from newer editors may violate these seemingly complicated rules but would be easy to fix with addition of either simple words or cap correction and a references to some posted (MOS?) rules. The only arguments (I can see) that may arise would be whether the band or the individual members are being referred to. The simple fix, for these disputes, would be to return that particular sentence back to the Triangular Diplomacy solution. This would appear to be inline with hundreds of other musical articles already observing a similar de facto standard. Any violations would be easy to correct and violations would not look outside of most grammar usage anyway. I don't really see any other way to satify so many different concepts, here. Trademarks don't work and the MOS contradicts itself and grammar in many places.\n",
      "If this solution is even remotely desired by the majority, and/or medcom team, here, this could be fine tuned by controlled input to medcom  mediators. Also implementation methods for clarifying to newcomers would need input on how to set up the MoS page, possibly. Beyond my knowledges. This MoS should apply to all musical articles, if we can make it work.\n",

What's the explanation?  The Cabal is, obviously, trying to manipulate the encyclopedia article 'jim bell', to keep its errors and omissions from being fixed.  But that's not enough.  They want to (need to!) conceal evidence of their nefarious activites, and that includes instantly (if possible) removing critical references to their misconduct, even on the talk:jim bell page.  (And all references to their misconduct will be critical:  The Cabal ignores all objections to its manipulations, other than to delete, reverse, erase, or otherwise conceal them.)   It remains no violation of WP rules to post from an IP address, particularly if the Cabal is preventing people from correcting an articles errors by any other means.  The Cabal blocks people illegally, so the public is forced to employ other tactics to avoid the Cabal's finagling fingers.  Fortunately, the identities of the Cabal are now (at least, in part) being exposed.  Skomorokh, strangely, is holding back, perhaps fearful of losing control over his high-priority 'assignment'.  Actually, if Skomorokh were honest and ethical, he would by now either have weighed in on the subject, or he would have explicitly dissociated himself from the dispute.  (Rather than merely remaining silent.) And since most of the incorrect 'misinformation' on 'jim bell' originated from Skomorokh's edits, he should be willing to step aside and allow his errors to be corrected.      71.36.117.224  \"\n",

It is about global health but again not about Medical Tourism which is a subcategory of globalized healthcare driven by the patient movement. For example the reference article starts with the example of Dave who had traveled to Tanzania as a part of global health rotation. In this case, Tanzania is neither the medical destination nor the developed country with collapsed or collapsing social health care system therefore no interest to medical tourism studies. It is clearly not relevant to the medical tourism. I think if medical tourism would be defined with economics terms such as imports and exports (by the way I do not like it in this way, just to clarify), we might not be so confused. Like developing countries (medical tourism destinations) are the exporters and the developed countries are the importers.

Afghans... British people.... Persians... or someone else...? Answer Afghanistan; Afghanistan would never do things like this. Even if they wanted, they are simply not able to do things like this and have also no reasons. British people; well British people want to destroy his image and have also the possibilities and the habit to do jobs like this. as a British people knower. Read this . Persians; Persians want to claim Jamaludin Afghan as a Persian personality and are able to do jobs like this. Let it be clear, his real biographies are destroyed and sometime later comes Persia with letters, with Jamaludin Afghan would have writed and after a time, comes his biographies of being from a Persian origins. Well is it not a little bite strange.... don't do you think so...? Except from this, the Persian people have allways try to claim Afghan history and the personalities of Afghans as their own. To claim Jamaludin Afghan as a Persian, they needed to have proves, to have proves, they needed to destroy the real proves (like his Biographies) and to prove what they are saying is right, they needed to create prove. So what is the true behind this letters..? IN PERSIANCA ENCLOPENDIA, they write (Government of India and Maǰmūʿa sources show that in Afghanistan he called himself the Sayyed “Rūmī” (Anatolian) or “Estanbolī” and claimed to be from Istanbul. The government of India reporter noted that he was a stranger to Afghanistan and spoke Persian like an Iranian.) well he have never claimed himself as a Estanboli or if being from Istanbul. this is what i call the propaganda of Persians! if he is not our, we will also don't late make it yours. well in letters and article wite where writed about him in Afghanistan (when he was in Afghanistan), they write only Sayed Jamalludin Afghan, nothing else. And about he was a stranger to Afghanistan. Well if he was a stranger to Afghanistan. How could he write a book about the Afghan History..? I think it says enough.

For instance, if you're Russian you may understand a Polish guy completely, but your Russian friend may have no idea what's going on. And if the Polish guy says something else, you might not understand him at all. It is very hard to study intelligibility because there is so much variation. So just because you understand (or don't understand) something in a related language it does not mean that is the case for all speakers (or even most speakers) and it definitely does not guarantee it goes the other way around.\n",

By following his posts re-1728 one can see what kind of mind is at work. First Maun's book did not exist, then someone 'reliable' told him it did.

JohnLp - Blackjack is not a valid source. Anyone can copy out from books by McCann et al but BJ adds his own POV - pages of it. Remove it and he goes beserk.

      "I was at Trent Bridge and I asked PWT to intervene to prevent the cricket site becoming corrupted with errors and Blackjacks efforts to move the contents of his site to WP. We discussed it and contacted KW who agreed there was a chance Blackjack's personalised style of editing was perpetrating errors because he lacked the level of source we have. How sad we have from BJ more hysterical self promotion. I got a student to have a look and they think you have used at least six sock puppets yourself. What makes all this so sad is that the edits you previously posted are fully available. Quite frankly, I don't know what your problem is John. You sent highly offensive emails to PWT which we were looking at on Friday - you sent offensive emails to the editor of the Cricket Statistcian. Neither I, nor Peter have altered pre 1750 cricket with other than the correct information. If Rambling Man(similar to your own Midnight Rambler Blackjack(see his blog)) wants to block these sites he is of course able to do it. What he will be doing is to enable Blackjack/JamesJJames/Albert WM or whatever it ws and several others to become sole editor. A man who has operated multiple sock puppets and is not regarded as an authority by Peter , Keith or any of the acknowledged expert who have publish books of great authority. I know Maun's view of John but it is for him to put it forward. It was PWT who edited and in response to JohnLp added some comments. It is indicative of the thrall Blackjack has laid over half a dozen people that this project is allowing a string of entries riddled with errors that could easily be altered and referenced by those with the correct sources, carry on because for some reason he is their man. WP is about facts not opinions. See 1728 Cricket for the facts on all newspaper entries for that year. Blackjack wants those blocked who spoil his game and I can, by private email, show anyone who wishes more evidence of his approach through his communications with people who disagree with him. The John Leach(MP) wasd posted by a student but you will recall that Blackjack at one time posted his own biography. It was more accurate - marginally. I will now leave this alone completely as Mr Maun's book has sold a thousand copies which I guess are all the people interested in this project so Blackjack's work is thankfully falling on deaf eyes so to speak. And it was PWT. Dr TM Asquith\n",

What this article is about is not how the Byzantiums got the symbol unfortunately for your nationalism, but how the Byzantiums used this symbol and how it is highly plausible as THE ONLY STATE TO FIRST USE THE SYMBOLS AS NATIONAL SYMBOLS, the Turks borrowed the symbols. Whether the Turks traveled through Places Greeks also went through has no bearing as this section is clearly about how when Istanbul was sieged, the only side using the symbols were the Byzantiums.  This however is obviously criptic to you and I am sure you will repeat your line about how Turks traveled through Babylon as some bizarre hope that it is relevant under this specific Byzantium section.

Are they saying that ones a Mexican crosses over the border he or she becomes white? that makes no sense. At what percentage does a mestizo become white, 50%, 75%, or 90%. According to the U.S census if a Mexican marks Mexican on the U.S Census, he or she will be classified as white. This leads to my final question, shouldn’t then most Mexicans be classified white, according to the CIA? Finally, I have been to several parts in Mexico and I have noticed that many, or the majority of Mexicans in central Mexico look whiter than Italians, French and middle eastern, which are classified as white everywhere. A large percentage of the Argentinean population has Amerindian mixture, doesn't that make them Mestizo's? Any ways, we will never know for sure until a large genetic sample is taken. I agree with having a predominate 35-45%, if you look at the Aregentina demographics it states that 57% of the population has ameridian ancestory, but 85-97% of the population states that they are white? I am from Jalisco, I would have to say that most people I have seen look more white than Italians or Middle Easterns in the U.S.\n",
