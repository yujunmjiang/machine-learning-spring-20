      "I find the remarks here of great interest, and indeed raise both issues I have considered at length and those which I have never considered before.\n",
      "\n",
      "a) Discrimination:: clear this list maybe hetergenous, but is clearly not indiscriminate. On the contrary, groups of Masons have discussed together and made certain decisions about their relations of amity with one another This is clear discriminate behaviour. As regards notability, clear the discussion about whether UGLE recognised the Rite of Memphis-Misraim in the 1850's clearly involved political decisions taking place in consequence of the Revolutions of 1848. Involving such key figures at Louis Blanc and Guiseppe Garibaldi, this is clearly highly notable people and events. And there has yet to be any serious discussion of the role of revolutionary freemasonry in the International Workingmen's Association, which will also of couse link us into the very contraversial figure of Mihail Bakunin. Onfortunately these issues are all far too notable.\n",
      "\n",
      "b) verifiability Well, this also relates to falsifiability and what is considered to be the truth. I have found the writings of Charles Peirce very helpful in this respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "c) Likewise  raises the issue of original research. This means that Wikipedia is immedtiately functioning at the level of intertextuality - i.e. the information contained on a wikipedia pagelinks other pieces of text, from which peopel may infer facts or events existing outside language. I would further argue that teh distinction between original research are the difference between relying on publisjed sources and unpublished ones, institutional denioted by the separate organisation of archives and libraries. I agree with [User:ALR|ALR]] that the task is a bit daunting, however if we can entice the anarcho-capitalists who produced such wonders on teh anacrhism talk pages a while ago I am sure we can create a suitable masters carpet of information from which Mason and Cowan can freely, fairly and friendly learn from and inform their fellow sentient creatures who have access to the internet. \"\n",

Based on the worthless rag of hers which is cited as a source in this article, she's nothing but a shill for Lenin and the rest of the commie gang.  In that rag, she not only shows egregious pro-Communist bias, but doesn't even bother to check the facts, much less look at the causes of the Kronstadt rebellion or even cite reliable historical sources on that subject.  She also discredits herself with absurd accusations of a White conspiracy to overthrow the Soviet government and even of the rebellion being motivated by anti-semitic racism among the sailors.  Furthermore, all the claims made in that rag are based on a case of begging the question: that is, since Lenin's Communist regime was good (major premise) and the Kronstadt rebellion harmed said regime (minor premise), suppressing the rebellion was justified.  Last but not least, the mere fact that the aforementioned rag was first published by a self-admitted socialist party by definition means that this source DOES NOT meet EITHER WP:NPOV OR WP:RS.

      "1) The objection that the art of wrestling never existed in india and it is imported from Iran and other outside countries is pure colonial tact. As you can find out that any good thing which comes from India is not real Indian / Aryan / Hindu but is imported from outside to India and we Indians are basterd offsprings from that .No new to we!! The great Alfanso Mangos are not local from Konkan region but are brought to India by the Portugies and such other numerious theories put in this new world firstly by the British and later by Amiricanus. Brother Iranians i have read little history of Iran. As we all know that originaly all Iranians befoure the birth of Islam were not muslims but Aryan as the word Iran itself stands for littrley as the dewwlling of Aryans outside mainland India. And what happned when the Arabs now converted to Islam attacted to Iran ?? Were the gret Iranians who now boast that they are the creator and founder of this wrestling art able to protect the own country and ther religion ?? No!! No!!. And to escape from this attct wher the Iranians flead ?? Even to China !! O.K NOW TELL ME WE Aryans/ Marathas / Hindus / Indians fought 1000 years to Islamic invision and reuled and 200 years of British rule and now where are we and where are those grate Mughals/ Brtish / Afghans/ Pakistanis/ Turks / ETC . Thre truth is that we Aryans / Marathas / Hindus / Indians not only surveyed but overcome this invision and eat those invaders and will eat in feauter. We were succesful not only to get freedom but also keep alive our Arya/ Hindu religion along with our gods , traditions , educations such as Ayurveda , Yoga . Dance , Music and all other properties.\n",

I have seen those WWF entertienment on cable TV sINCE 1992 and from the begining i was desliking to this Americanus beggares play. But in reality in my surrounding i have observerd great wrestlers and seen how much respect our Maratha society gives to these wrestlers.The traditional Maratha wrestling and wrestler has many sides and aspects , i will discuss it later but any way one can understand it if he is clever.Allthough these Indian wrestler are not successful in international competations such as Olympics , But if you see the ecomomic and weather conditions of India you may find the answer.In our Maratha society wrestiling is a good social title and way of life such as Docters and other professionals.   I use to workout and do exircise when i was in school and college and aimes to earn great body. I never exirsised in traditional Indian mud wrestling gym but in western kind of modern gym and before that some traditional exirsises and other like cricket , boxind etc.\n",

Yet I have the right to feel offended when someone says every single Mormon man is a misogynist who sees every woman as a baby - making machine.  I have the right to defend law enforcement officers against the charge that their hard work consists of gossip.  Maybe they never solved the Kupcinet case, but their hard work has made the world safer for you and me and our parents.  If I were defending an extremist like a Ku Klux Klan member, then I would understand you pointing out that I ain't in the Klan.  But sheriffs aren't extremists.

      "You point out that newspaper articles reporting Dr. Harold Kade's egregious mistakes, one of which put an innocent man in jail for five months, say nothing about Kupcinet, therefore they aren't relevant to her case.  If the articles said he was a careless driver who got off work one night and then crashed his car into a truck carrying tissue samples to another lab for analysis, thereby making that person's death a total mystery, then your point would be valid.  An accident that Dr. Kade might have caused when he wasn't on the timeclock tells us nothing about his competence while he was on the clock.  We know he was on the clock when he put an innocent man in jail for five months. We know he was on the timeclock when he screwed up another case that was unrelated to that unfortunate man.  Therefore his screwy actions while he was working are relevant to yet another mysterious death that he was supposed to solve but didn't (Kupcinet). At least he didn't solve it to the satisfaction of those gossip queens known as sheriffs.  If they didn't cut open her dead body, then they knew nothing, right?  The woman's father didn't see the autopsy, either, and he actually was considered a gossiper by some people, so to hell with him, too.  Right ?\n",

Nixon did, in fact, make a brief comment about Kennedy-Monroe when he was interviewed for 60 Minutes in 1984, ten years after he resigned.  Video and audio of it exist, but I, for one, never will add it to Wikipedia.  If I did, Wildhartlivie would want a footnote citation that identifies the producer of the segment and what he ate for breakfast on the day it aired.  Someone else would remove it on the basis that as long as it had nothing to do with China, anything Nixon said about others' flaws was a lie. That's good enough for me, but you're just going to say Watergate was a separate entity that had nothing to do with Kennedy or Monroe, therefore Nixon could have said they were both transsexuals and that's legitimate. \n",

He changed his name back (legally) to Harris Levey around 1953, just before marriage.

Generally, in peer-reviewed literature, the terms used are defined and we can say that one author who defines \"\"Christian terrorism\"\" as terrorism motivated by Christian belief and another who uses the term \"\"Christian religious terrorism\"\" with the same definition are referring to the same thing.  However, another author who uses the expression \"\"Christian terrorism\"\" and defines it as ethnic terrorism where religion is part of ethnic identity means the same thing as authors writing about \"\"religious communal terrorism\"\" carried out by Christians, or \"\"nationalist terrorism\"\" between different religious groups.\n",

It's about what the closing statement there said, that just because a particular word is not used explicitly in a source, does not mean that the source does not apply to a page – editors can use common sense to examine the context within the source. Thinking back to the discussions about the Lebanon section (now made somewhat moot by the Schbley source, that examines in detail the Maronite Monks), there was discussion of whether it was SYNTH to consider a United Nations source, because it used the word \"\"genocide\"\" instead of the word \"\"terrorism\"\". I'm pointing out that there is now some precedent for using common sense in evaluating the language of such sources, in context. If you or another editor sees common sense in that instance as indicating that genocide is not terrorism, that's still a discussion we can have. So that's why I provided that link.

Despite categorical denials by the EMI representative who accompanied the group, the label, which was under political pressure, released the band from their contract.

      "I am glad you are working on a rewrite and I will be glad to help out. There are 2 problems I see with what you are doing so far. One is that you really can't tell this story without a little historical context and in particular you can't leave out Morgan and the fruit fly work (and the change in the perception of what mutation was and how it affected the genetic variability of the populstion from the ideas of the earlier Mendalians such as De Vries). So at some point something about it has to go back in. The other is that most modern historians of science (Larson, Bowler, Gould) treat the foundation of population genetics as the start (Gould calls it the first phase) of the modern synthesis, not part of the run up to it. I realize this view differs somewhat from the view of Mayr who emphasizes more the later parts of the synthesis that involved the integration of other fields of biology with population genetics as the actual synthesis, but on this point I think, the article needs to follow the views of most current historians of science rather than those of Mayr or the other participants. There is a reason why historians do not rely exclusively on first person accounts of the participants in an event, and the biggest has to do with perspective. Hopefully we can resolve these issues with compromise inline with the best traditions of Wikipedia rather than the worst traditions of Wikipedia (edit warring) )\n",

I could make a case for Wikipedia being harmed more by religious or political advocacy editing than by paid advocacy editing (but see below for why I think this might change).\n",
      "There are however, a couple of things that are special about paid advocacy editing which IMO require extra care.\n",
      "First, Scientology cannot do anything to suddenly have ten times more followers. They are already doing the best they can and the pool of potential converts is resistant.\n",
      "Paid advocacy editing, on the other hand, can easily gain as many paid advocacy editors as desired by simply paying more. Think of the difference between getting emails advocating politics or religion vs. emails about online pharmacies. The first is annoying, but self limiting; the second gets bigger and bigger as long as it remains profitable. Our article on Email spam gives numbers like 200 billion spam messages sent per day and 97% of all emails being unwanted. I think Jimbo is right to be especially concerned over something that could grow exponentially.\n",
      "Second, we really cannot do anything to convince most religion or politics advocates to change their ways other than blocking or banning them, but we can make big changes in how paid advocacy editors operate. If it becomes well known that the advocacy editors who don't edit articles directly but instead make talk page requests get better results and that the sneaky kind of paid advocacy editor usually gets reverted, the customers will naturally go with the service that gets the best results. We can make that happen, but again it takes special care.\n",

The important thing to me is that things stay NPOV and factual accurate, which includes among other things retaining/expanding information about objections to the concept, and not trying to say that anyone \"\"defends heteronormativity\"\". I agree w you about prose being improved, and while I am not of course looking to do that, I must express a concern that things remain fair and reasonable in regards to areas capable of rationale debate.

WP:NPA says: \"\"Specific examples of personal attacks include but are not limited to: Accusatory comments such as \"\"Bob is a troll\"\", or \"\"Jane is a bad editor\"\" can be considered personal attacks if said repeatedly, in bad faith, or with sufficient venom.  This situation clearly qualifies.  And WP:RPA says that I can refactor to eliminate the personal attack.  I have done so.  It isn't an edit war.

I believe that the microscopic treatment this article has received is evidence of bias against its subject matter, while the simple fact is clear that this surgeon is referenced repeatedly in other wikipedia articles about related surgical topics. In  addition, the very nature of the subject matter should be protected a topic given the level of bigotry, discrimination, and violence including murder against people who receive these medical treatments. The very fact that a surgeon like Toby Meltzer, with such a prestigious medical background, chooses to concentrate on such service to other people, who have few if any equally qualified alternatives, is notable by itself, without need for any further citation. These surgeries are in and of themselves pioneering, and largely non-existent on any measurable scale before the 1960s. Even now, the number of frequent U.S. practitioners is few, including only Meltzer and Marci Bowers, MD (who was previously a patient of Meltzer!), on a truly regular basis.  19:29, 17 September 2006.\"\n",

I made such a minor edit to the article, and if there was any mistake, could he not have merely pointed out any errors to me as a newbie instead? Or does he have a problem with allowing newcomers to work on wikipedia as well and merely try to land them in trouble instead? I am not really sure why he is determined to complain about me no matter what edit I make, but his aggressive stance is clear, and if everyone were to behave this way towards newbies, I am sure wikipedia would become a very isolated place, which it is indeed not.

      "1. The first sentence says tomoi is the result of \"\"Siamese influence in the area\"\" and provides two references. However, this is not in the given citations. These references deal with the history of the Thai community in Kedah, but make no mention of tomoi or kickboxing. Am I wrong?\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The word tomoi is usually said to be a cognate of dhoi muay rather than a derivative term. Anyone fluent in both Malay and Thai will be aware of the many cognates such as the words for \"\"lizard\"\", \"\"door\"\", \"\"key\"\", and the numerous Sanskrit-derived terms. Muay or moi comes from the Sanskrit mavya, therefore it would be incorrect to say that one derives from the other. They are similar because they come from the same source and because the two countries are neighbours.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. I wrote in the article that tomoi in the Malay language refers to the local style of kickboxing while tinju is the generic word for any boxing art, particularly the western kind. I sourced a dictionary for this sentence. Yet the sentence has been edited and now defines tomoi as the \"\"sport of Siamese Kedah\"\", while still retaining the given source. In other words, it's not in the citation given, once again.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Why is so much emphasis given to Kedah when the art is most often associated with Kelantan? This is consistent with the sources provided since all of them mention Kelantan. A major reason why the sport is not so well-known today is because it was banned in Kelantan where it was most popular. The state government even planned to rename tomoi \"\"Kelantan boxing\"\". Yes it is practiced in Kedah and other states as well, but to state conclusively that tomoi comes from Kedah is simply not supported by any source or even general public opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The first few sentences of the history section are atrociously-written and repeat some of the same material which I had already written in and sourced.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Language like \"\"it is a clear fact\"\" seems pointy.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. The first paragraph of the history section does not deal with tomoi or any martial art. Why does it matter how many temples are in Kedah? What does the dominant religion or language of the state have to do with anything? The same two references are provided for the paragraph once again, and neither are relevant to the article. But the sourced paragraph is followed by the sentence \"\"The art of \"\"Tomoi\"\" or \"\"ToiMauy\"\"(ต่อยมวย) were teach and practice among these Siamese communities in Kedah and Kelantan\"\" which is unsourced and entirely POV.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. The origin of Indochinese kickboxing is a disputed topic. Authors like Draeger mention Chinese and Indian influence on muay Thai, which can logically be extended to tomoi, pradal serey, etc. But then there are those (unreliable) sources which claim bokator as the common ancestor. I thought it fair to say that their origin is unclear. Yet the article states very conclusively that tomoi is of Siamese origin and goes on to mention the regional styles of muay boran. Silat Embo (the precursor of tomoi) and Siku 12 (a related style) are not mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. \"\"It is also a clear fact that the system of Tomoi, be the guard,stance,and striking techniques, is identical to Muay Thai.\"\" This is actually true. And putting aside any modern political boundaries, tomoi is the same as muay Thai and Muay Lao. I can say this from personal experience. However, that doesn't necessarily mean tomoi came from muay Thai. As mentioned before, they may all have their origins in Cambodia or somewhere else.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. The history section continues by saying that boxers originally wrapped their hands in hemp ropes, and provides an irelevant source which only deals with muay Thai in Thailand. The editor then goes on to say that these hand-wraps did not exist prior to Ayutthaya. First of all, boxers fought bare-fisted before the custom of wrapping the hands. And more importantly, sources like Draeger say the date at which boxers first began wrapping their hands \"\"cannot be known with certainty\"\". And even if the practice does not predate Ayutthaya, that doesn't mean it comes from Ayutthaya. And even if it does, that doesn't mean tomoi comes from Thailand. That's quite a stretch.   \"\n",

      "\"::::::: Hi everyone this is the first time I've closely examined this page. I've been heavily involved in OWS since last October, which means two things: 1) I know a bunch of stuff first-hand, including things the media has failed to document, and 2) sometimes an NPOV is going to be difficult for me to maintain. That said, I have many concerns with this article, mostly on the facts. For example, this quote above: the rules of Zuccotti Park aren't self-justifying; this quote and others in the article seem to indicate that they are actually material. They're not; they don't actually exist; there is a rule-making procedure that is required by city law which the police and Brookfield have totally ignored. So, using them to explain police action without quoting or citing a police source is not NPOV. Secondly, these rules have nothing to do with the police tactics used that day, which were employed all over the Financial District, well outside the region where the \"\"rules\"\" of Zuccotti Park apply. What happened was the police grab whoever they feel like at any given moment, apply laws like the disorderly conduct statute willy-nilly (\"\"blocking pedestrian traffic\"\" is frequently absurdly applied), and have a goal not of enforcing laws but of maintaining an extralegal standard of order. This is called \"\"crowd control policing\"\", and it explicitly involves unconstitutional conduct and arrests. Remember, sometimes a point of view is political despite being neutral, i.e. based in empirical observation and fact. Thanks for your work, and perhaps you can offer some guidance as to how first-person expertise can properly be used to make sure a wiki article is factual and not based on flawed or incomplete media interpretation.  \n",

I must once again point out, though, that it is not merely their \"\"poor understanding of the English language,\"\" when even The American Heritage Dictionary and the Wikipedia Meat article separates fish from meat. But, anyway, a pescetarian is a type of vegetarian, as valid sources state. The lead does not directly call pescetarians vegetarians (due to dispute), but only presents that, in some authoritive dictionaries, vegetarianism may include the consumption of fish. As stated before, the lead then makes sure to tie that type of diet to pescetarianism, and note how pescetarianism being thought of as vegetarianism is disputed. Merriam-Webster even now defines pescetarianism  as \"\"vegetarians who eat fish\"\" (as I've already mentioned)...so, clearly, there is validity in mentioning pescetarianism as being an aspect of vegetarianism (as much as veganism is), especially as long we note the dispute between the two terms, and especially when pescetarianism is present within the body of this article, below the lead.   \"\n",

In recent years, Wikipedia has likely gained in importance as a \"\"vetting\"\" tool for employers, clients and others considering doing business with someone. Naturally, the one doing the vetting has the lion's share of responsibility in judging an entry's reliability and supplementing it with other research. That said, do we bear some degree of ethical obligation to researchers to ensure an entry presents, as far as possible, an accurate, well-rounded picture of the subject? In the case of Ms. Caesar, I was concerned that universities or other organizations looking to employ her and/or give her some sort of public platform would come away with the impression that nothing about her merits further scrutiny.

C3 is the lowest note in My All, Emotions, You're So Cold, and I believe other songs. A1 is my lowest note and F7 is my highest and Im a Lyric Baritone. I don't know if Mariah has ever sang above the piano or in the second octave because there is no audio to prove it. All I know is alot of people exaggerate her voice alot. Notes should be checked before saying what they are. People start rumors about alot of things like the note in You're So Cold being G2. Its not. My way of checking notes is by using a keyboard. its pretty accurate too. Its better than a tuner. Tuners can be thrown off by the slightest extra sound. the best way to check a note using a tuner is to copy the note by singing it yourself. But keyboards are easy cause it wont produce a note an octave lower or anything as most people tend to do if they feel a note is too high or an octave higher if the note is too low. You should always check a note yourself and ask another person if you can rely on them.  06:27\n",

These people uses something called \"\" bias racism \"\" to hide their racist intentions to prove their point on one hand, but on the other hand they back it with evidence to make it acceptable, to the point where you can't accuse them of being racist because they would use stuffs genetics or human evolution to back up their claims as reasonable.

(I wait for further evidence that TG/TS is caused by biological factors, and thus the term \"\"biological male/female\"\" becomes complicated in even research... no one would ever state that a woman with CAIS is \"\"biologically\"\" a male...)

      "If a statement with two facts is supported by a source and one fact and the source are updated, check whether the source is positioned in the sentence to make it look like the source also supports the other fact. Then be sure the source does support both facts. Otherwise, readers will be misled. If that source does not actually support the second fact, you should find a source for the second fact or preserve the original source and place or edit it so that readers will know which fact is supported by which source. If a fact does not have a source cited for it, the fact can be challenged, edited, or deleted by any editor (the exception being, as Wikipedians sometimes say, that no source is needed for the fact that \"\"the sky is blue\"\", or for any fact not likely to be challenged). Much about HSA has been challenged in the past (possibly because of political dislike toward Dr. Moskowitz) and sourcing should be carefully done.\n",

      "Andrew, frankly, you are mistaken. It is incorrect to refer to a baroque guitar as a \"\"ten-string guitar\"\". No one refers to the baroque lute as \"\"the 24-string lute\"\", but correctly as the 13-course lute. This is a well-established musicological/organological convention. \"\"12-string guitar\"\" is the only exception to this, and that is only because the term has been disseminated by the popular \"\"cult(ure)\"\" in the usual brainwashed ignorance of the masses. If two strings function as one string, they are a COURSE, not two separate strings. In contrast, a ten-stringed guitar has ten separate strings each of which can be separately fretted. This is not the case on the baroque guitar, which effectively only has five courses. Moreover, the term \"\"ten-string\"\" guitar has come to signify a particular instrument, which is NOT a baroque guitar. You are evidently not a musicologist/organologist/semiologist/semantician so I don't see what you think you will achieve by being bothersome about this issue, which relates to organology and semantics.\"\n",

About 5 years ago I read the book and about half way down the first page I realized that in the universe that Harper Lee created in this book, the actual story is very simple and innocent - Scout is just explaining how Jem broke his arm. I have always plumbed the depths of this book, talked about the profundity, it's allusion, the allegory. But this reread I reckon I saw things through Scouts eyes and just listend to what she was saying.

Over here you write: \"\"You know, I like your Strauss-Kahn addition, using good sourcing, but this bit about bootlegs is your weak area. You need to find a source that says that Fogerty's music can be found on bootlegs\"\": that being so, why don't you do it yourself, and thus help additions those less skillful at manipulating WP than you, try to contribute? Instead of actively deleting and obstructing the info being included, under increasingly fanciful pretexts (incidentally, \"\"source that says that Fogerty's music can be found on bootlegs\"\" is easily found on Youtube and elsewhere, e.g. http://www.freetimeweb.nl/home/muziek/ccr/johnfogerty_bootleg.html (I'm sure even you can google \"\"Fogerty bootleg\"\", though actually I didn't add that info - I only supplied the ref, before you deleted it all). But you deleted it or had it deleted, instead of supporting it with adjustments, as you could've done, improving instead of obstructing - how's that for an idea?). You appear to be an amateur psychopat, taking out your failed real life on innocents on WP. You a-soul. Be a good person. Instead of being destructive and obstructive, be constructive. If you know how - if not, try to learn. Even a miserable psychopat like you can turn around. Try. - Plus, incidentally, I haven't been edit-warring but reverting your edit-warring and vandalism (check history if you suddenly don't recall - but your memory is tendentially selective, I'm sure, recalling only that which supports your lies, right?). I'm no expert at WP and have no time to become one - I only wanted to contribute, not to get embroiled with an apparent psychopat like you. Plus re new IPs: if frequent power-outages happen to change my IP, don't flatter yourself that it's in response to your unacceptable behaviour: you're not on par with hurricane Nina. At all. You're merely a small gust temporarily confusing, but achieving nothing - except making people tire of you. You really are a tiresome fogey, as demonstrated when you write and admit: \"\"despite the truth of what you were inserting\"\". Well, that truth being so, why don't you help fix it, instead of hounding away the contributor? But you apparently don't think facts should have primacy on WP, rather your quarrelling should, right? - I'm no expert on the rules you misuse, and won't waste time to become one - as I have a real life. I merely contribute where I can, as an attitude to life. Try it. You might like it. Actually -). Instead of perfecting being an apparent grumpy old man and failed psychopat, scouring WP for victims. You won, because I'm not interested in your fight. Now you've successfully excluded good info from WP, info which even you concede is \"\"the truth\"\". That's a pyrrhic victory if ever there was one. Hope this little letter changes you for the better, because that's truly needed. Try it: Help info get on to WP, instead of picking quarrels by deleting what even you call \"\"the truth\"\". Focus on getting correct info on to WP, instead of getting lost in \"\"the system\"\". - That's just an idea, but think it over. It might do you good. Get well soon. Bye now.

There is evidence that supports it, and is strongly shown when the japanese diplomat said \"\"Who say?, Who saw it?\"\" after Tanaka gave the victory to Huo when they were walking out of the arena. Anno Tanaka replied \"\"I saw myself\"\" and then went on telling him that he was a disgrace to the japanese people. Also right after Huo collapsed from his final blow, he said \"\"wait\"\" and held him, observing his face and it looks like he realised or must have seen.

That's not reliable. There are studies presented by outright bigots. That's not reliable. There are studies that claim to show one thing, but do not. That's not reliable. The organizations in the article, which have membership in the hundreds of thousands of scientists and researchers around the world, are not unreliable nor do they present subjectively biased conclusions based on what they studied. Pointing out a difference, for example, of a male child of two lesbians not being as aggressive as the male child of a man and woman is very trivial. The conclusions that the scientific world has come to is that, while there may be some isolated differences, which exist in all types of families not just those with same-sex parents, it is inconceivable to make the generalization that one is better or more efficient than the other. The only contrasts which my have significant differences are those families who do not have two parents, no matter their gender. So there is no rational basis, in my mind and obviously the mind of most studied science on this, to even try to contradict that. –  (talk · email) \"\n",

The argument of Yellow Up that \"\"This is just one of thousands of trials against military evaders\"\" which was rpeated by Danntm \"\"just a simple, unimportant court-martial\"\" is factually not true. It is very exceptional for the IDF to grant a political objector a full court martial where he can be defended by a lawyer and call witnesses (and make political speeches). It does not happen more often than once in a decade. The usual procedure is \"\"disciplinary proceedings\"\" where you are judged by a commaning officer in his bureau, with no lawyer or witnesses, and it lasts about five minutes - but the officer can only give a maximum of 28 days, unlike the full court martial which can give years. But the descision to have a full court martial is far from routine, it is taken on the highest levels. Then there is the fact that the act which the trial was about - a soldier writing \"\"subversive\"\" graffiti of 117 tanks and other military vehicles - is far from routine, it is certainly unique in Israel and I think quite exeptional for armies worldwide. And finally, Majorly jusitifed the decision to delete by stating \"\"The vast majority were delete comments, and there seemed to be consensus to delete\"\" . Now, I took a look at the deletion log of article submitted on January 8 together with mine . As far as I could see, virtually all of those which were fianlly deleted had a real ovewhelming majoroity in favor, many of them complete unanimity. The court martial artcile had nine in favor of deletion against five opposing deletion (if you don't count my own objection, with it there would be nine to six).  I saw that another article which was put up for deleteion in nearly the same time Arnie_Ginsburg, the result was  \"\"no concensus, default keep\"\". \n",

I made an act of good faith by offering to remove the Israeli part, even though I have every right to keep it.

      "Yes, that's probably the best way to view the development of that article. However, I can't go into that much detail myself because I certainly don't have the time to do that much research. That quote from Iliad is rather odd. Homer seems to be refering to Hesiod's earlier Theogony; but the details are different. The Perseus Digital Library (whose pages take some time to load; so for anybody reading this, be patient) translates Homer's quote just as you say (line 14 onwards), and has this to say for Theogony (line 720 onwards). I'm no classicist, but I'd be weary of that bit of text - it is certinly odd and probably should not be taken at face value so naïvely. As you say, everywhere else (as far as I know) he refers to the underworld as the \"\"domain of hades\"\". As for Erebus, the quotes from Iliad (under the heading: 3 from Homer, Iliad), at face value, seem to indicate that it is a place. But this is merely a misunderstanding of what Erebus is. Erebus is the gloom, the darkness of the underworld, the \"\"place of dark mists\"\" as you put it. Replace \"\"Erebus\"\" with \"\"darkness of the underworld\"\" or the like and the quotes make just as much sense as the assumption that Erebus is a physical location. However, I don't know of any source that explicitly states that it is a location in the underworld; so, again, where does that quote come from?  \"\n",

      "I have been away from Wikipedia for years, and largely due to users like the despicable, self-deluded Gavin Collins. To return here after so much time and find that he has been removed from the site is an utter joy, on several levels. Justice has finally been served, proving that the system here actually works, albeit slowly. However, I can't help but feel sick about the time, energy, and effort the Wikipedia community has expended (i.e., wasted) in dealing with this Gavin Collins, a terrifically disruptive and possibly mentally disturbed individual. It is incredible to me that one user has caused such extensive damage and unending headache, heartache, and loss of resources. Yes, instead of spending hundreds of hours dealing with Gavin Collins' nonsensical, myopic, obtuse, elliptical, deconstructive, and dense argumentation, we could all have been making this a better place. And now, he's gone. So in a sense, I suppose those hours lost were not for nothing. And at the end of the day, Gavin Collins' dubious legacy is deeply stamped.

Its most known series of photographs is that of the \"\"Blind men\"\". By always combining the text and the image, it photographs blind men of birth and their request to express their vision of the beauty.  With the limit of the indiscretion, Sophie Calle often takes risks to work out her settings in scene. She follows people in the street to photograph them, she posed as a maid in a Venetian hotel to inspect and photograph the personal effects of customers. Works of Sophie Calle are diverse. The context in which the texts and photographs fit makes it possible to often qualify them \"\"artistic performance\"\". The public is often shocked by Calle's works.

Rather than attempt to determine which sources have more authority, I suggest we look at the actual definitions of the words.  All the sources agree that the Moon's orbit has no loops.

If you going to rely on \"\"documents\"\" from third party sites do a little research on the documents, like if its a PDF save it and take a look at the publishers marks on the file, find out what you can.

That would $18,585.60/yr however is only 48 weeks there is 52 weeks/yr isn't there that means they missed a 4 weeks of pay.

The policy requires that where multiple or conflicting perspectives exist within a topic each should be presented fairly. None of the views should be given undue weight or asserted as being judged as \"\"the truth\"\", in order that the various significant published viewpoints are made accessible to the reader, not just the most popular one. It should also not be asserted that the most popular view, or some sort of intermediate view among the different views, is the correct one to the extent that other views are mentioned only pejoratively. Readers should be allowed to form their own opinions.\"\"\n",

As the name suggests, the neutral point of view is a point of view, not the absence or elimination of viewpoints. The elimination of article content cannot be justified under this policy on the grounds that it is \"\"POV\"\". Article content should clearly describe, represent, and characterize disputes within topics, but without endorsement of any particular point of view. Articles should provide background on who believes what and why, and which view is more popular; detailed articles might also contain evaluations of each viewpoint, but must studiously refrain from taking sides.\"\"\n",

So, my addition that is only the GREC who includes all territories as catalan is correct and, even, necessary in order to let \"\"Readers [...] to form their own opinions\"\".

      "FyzixFighter, you are making some of the same mistakes as Brews. You seem to think that we can take that four part expansion of acceleration in terms of polar coordinates and read some physics into it. We can't. The polar terms tell us nothing about any particular motion.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they are nevertheless very useful. We can use the expressions in a properly modelled differential equation that involves real physical input. The radial convective term is used as a centrifugal force in the two body gravity problem.\n",

      "The expression is merely the mathematical form for a force that changes the direction of motion and acts in the radial direction.\n",

      "When we construct the planetary orbital equation, we end up with a radial gravity force inwards and a centrifugal force radially outwards. We have a scalar equation in the radial length and the two forces equate to the second time derivative of the radial length. You have got too much bogged down in trivia over matters like whether or not the second time derivative of radial length is entitled to be termed radial acceleration or not.\n",

But while I agree with his final conclusion, it isn't quite the right argument to use, that \"\"we must assume the worst,\"\" to get it. So I thought I would try once again to explain how the different wordings of this problem, that seem to say the same thing, can lead to different solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ultimate cause of confusion is the math-specific definition of the term \"\"event.\"\" When a random experiment produces a result, that result is not called an \"\"event,\"\" it is an \"\"occurrence.\"\" \"\"Event\"\" is defined to be the subset of all possible occurrences that have some defining common property. So if I flip a coin a hundred times, there are only two possible events: \"\"heads\"\" and \"\"tails.\"\" There will most likely be about fifty occurrences of each event; and each occurrence will fit into only one event.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I draw a card from a standard deck of playing cards, there are lots of possible events and/or occurrences. Some of them overlap. They include \"\"black card,\"\" \"\"spade,\"\" \"\"honor card (TJQKA),\"\" \"\"Ace,\"\" and \"\"Ace of Spades.\"\" The occurrence \"\"black card\"\" can be in the event \"\"spade\"\" or \"\"club\"\" as well. Note that an occurrence can fit into other events, but not vice versa. An occurrence of \"\"spade\"\" is also an occurrence of \"\"black card,\"\" but the event \"\"spade\"\" is most definitely not the event \"\"black card.\"\" Since determining probabilities involves counting the number of elements in events, the difference can be crucial when less specific observations are applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a famous problem that isolates this difference between an occurrence and an event. It is called Bertrand's Box Paradox Suppose you have three indistinguishable boxes, each with two indistinguishable drawers. Inside each drawer is a coin. Box #1 has two gold coins, Box #2 has two bronze coins (I can't resist the temptation to use the initials B and G), and Box #3 has one of each. You pick a box at random, and open a drawer at random. If the coin is gold, what are the odds that the coin in the box's other drawer is also gold (i.e., that it is Box #1)?\n",
      "\n",
      "The first issue here, common to story problems, is that this problem describes an occurrence, not an event. We must extrapolate what the possible outcomes of the actions are, to define the event (the set of possible occurrences) that defines the conditional probability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The incorrect approach to Bertrand's Box Paradox is to say that you narrowed the identity of the box to two possibilities, Box #1 and Box #3. That the \"\"event\"\" matches the observation \"\"the box has at least one gold coin.\"\" This is wrong because there are other ways to describe occurrences in that event. If you pick box #3, then no matter which drawer you open, the occurrence is in the event \"\"the box has at least one gold coin.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The correct approach is to define the event as the set of all possible occurrences where you open a drawer with a gold coin. Every possible occurrence that is consistent with the problem description is in this event (remember, it's a set), and every possible element of this event is consistent with the problem description. Both of those conditions have to be true for the event set we extrapolate as the condition. This set has three elements, not two. In two of those three possible occurrences, the box's other coin is gold. The correct answer is 2/3.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have seen a variation of Bertrand's Box Paradox used to represent the Boy or Girl Paradox. You are the organizer of a neighborhood swim meet. During the meet, you get a phone call from Mr. Smith, who is delayed and can't pick up his children after the meet. He says \"\"Tell my two kids to go home with a neighbor. Their names are Sarah and...\"\" and the phone connection goes dead. There are four families of two children in the meet, and they conveniently include the four possibilities BB, BG, GB, and GG. What are the odds that Mr. Smith has two daughters?\n",
      "\n",
      "This occurrence can be described as \"\"a two-child family includes at least one girl.\"\" But not the event you need to use as the condition. Mr. Smith could have mentioned a boy's name first; and if that boy had a sister, that occurrence would have been an element of the set \"\"a two-child family includes at least one girl.\"\" So that event fails one of the two criteria. You get the answer 1/3 by erroneously using this event.\n",
      "\n",
      "The correct event is just that Mr. Smith mentioned that he had a daughter, and compares to \"\"you opened a drawer with a gold coin\"\" in the Box Paradox.

The indef block was premature (not unwarranted in my highly biased opinion) as all the evidence uninvolved editors were presented with was a vast, ugly sprawling page of crap that would be extremely difficult to tease out.  Any editor who didn't have involvement with him would be hard-pressed to come to any conclusion based on it.  The whole reason I delayed starting an AN or ANI thread was so I could thoroughly review his contribs and create a solid final version that would hopefully be more convincing than what I have now.  I'm in process for that, and this will be useful; also helpful for the arb case that will almost certainly land in my lap.

      "This relative absence of French-American political and social unity helps to explain anti-French sentiment in the United States. French historian Justin Vaïsse has proposed that an important cause of overtly expressed public hostility toward France in the United States is the small number of Americans of direct French descent1. http://www.politiqueinternationale.com/revue/article.php?id_revue=12&id;=228&content;=synopsis. While he acknowledges that this is not the direct cause of anti-French sentiments, he argues that it explains why these sentiments can be expressed publicly, without being seen as a gross violation of political correctness. Vaïsse contends that by comparison, the public display of such sentiments towards other ethnic groups or nationalities would be met by strong disapproval. He proposes that as France has no powerful and organised lobby to defend it, it is socially and politically acceptable in the United States to express negative sentiments of the FrenchPierre Verdaguer, \"\"A Turn-of-the-Century Honeymoon? The Washington Post's Coverage of France\"\", French Politics, Culture & Society, vol. 21, no. 2, summer 2003.\n",
      " Just to answer, I've read before that the proportion of french descendant in the US is way higher than thought because as the french colonized the New World at the same time as the Brits but got outnumbered pretty quickly, they were mixed into the mainstream america.

At virtually every turn, when I requested a policy clarification as a 2-month user, if I even got a cite, it was only to a whole policy page, and never with a diff to my alleged offense.

As near as I can tell, WP:POINT is intended to refer to my politely proposing a change to WP:V (my first policy suggestion) and disclosing what I regarded as an edit war about the issue. Instead of any comments on the merits (except one positive one), I received consistent criticism about my poor formatting followed by refusal to address the merits because (apparently) it was obviously unnecessary to answer. Q. When one has made a policy suggestion in good faith and one receives zero discussion on its negatives and significant negative discussion on one's person and presentation, is one refusing to get the point if one continues politely requesting the specific demerits of the proposal that would indicate nonconsensus on its merits?\n",
      "See whole user discussion. As near as I can tell, WP:HAR (first I've heard of this charge against me) is intended to refer to my appropriate-level user warnings in response to an editor using obscenity and assuming bad faith this is only the most reasonable guess, of course. After he stated he was entitled to assume bad faith, he changed up and claimed facetiously he really was assuming good faith. My links there indicate specifically what behavior I referred to. I know of no other case which might come near to harassment. Q. When one uses edit warnings in full compliance with policy and is met with continuing bad faith, is one harassing?\n",
      "See whole COI discussion. As near as I can tell, WP:DE is intended to refer primarily to my first extended correction of a user charging me with COI, along with a suggestion that the accusing user may also have COI. Certainly I might have been overstrong in that edit (I recognize not noticing the 200-word limit, but I adverted that myself). But again, there was no indication of why a donor to a political candidate has the sort of close relationship envisioned by COI. There was one attempt at googling me (and I'm not looking up the personal details policy right now) which turned up nothing undisclosed besides my blog comments but this was described as \"\"considerable involvement of ... promotional activities\"\". Recall there are about 60,000 Ron Paul Meetup volunteers, and nearly that many donors. If I worked for a 60,000-member workplace there might be a bit more point, but even that would be debatable in good faith. Q. Is every political donor or Meetup member forbidden from editing candidate-related articles neutrally, or only those who willingly disclose the relationship?\n",

I am completely unfamiliar with operating in such an environment other than to do one's best to WP:AGF, to complain properly and carefully, and to accept potential suffering for it.

      "Hello.  To Jeffro77 above...  The original and first reference that I put in was Thomas Cahill, and his book The Gifts of the Jews - How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way Everyone Thinks and Feels.   And I originally put that ref alone.  The Wilson ref came later on, from a search, and at the request of Jeppiz.   But Cahill alone I felt was overall sufficient at that point.  (And that Cahill book had literally zero to do with anything with Jehovah’s witnesses, or any JW books or journals or sermons.)    That wasn’t even on my mind in that sense, nor did I look at ANY Watchtower publications regarding this article or this specific matter.  Cahill had nothing to do with that.       And even Jeppiz admitted a number of times that it was a reliable source and ok.       But the Wilson source I provided here later on (and then soon on the article itself) was only at the demand of Jeppiz, for another source.   He kept insisting to find something else, etc, so I did a search, and the Wilson thing was even more pointed in a way, and it’s in a pro-JW website, “strictly genteel”, which transcribed the noted WT book “Is the Bible Really the Word of God?”, and the link can be found here http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/wordofgod/wordofgod4.html.       (Also, to DougWeller, hello.   I’m still not sure why you say that I got the name of the book wrong.   That’s what’s stated as the source.    J.A. Wilson.   And “The World History of the Jewish People”.   At least that’s he main part of the name of the book, and I believe Wilson was a co-author of that or something.)    But, to Jeffro, you seem to think (incorrectly) that I probably had the Wilson ref as paramount, when in actuality that was just a side thing and accident, because of subsequent demands and circumstances on this Talk page.   Cahill was actually my guy on this specific matter on the Exodus matter, NOT Wilson necessarily nearly as much.      The exact (in-context) quote from Cahill’s book says this:   \n",

      "“When we examine the considerable extant literatures of Mesopotamia and Egypt, we find no obvious mention of the Israelites.  If, as the majority of scholars have provisionally concluded, Israel escaped from Egypt in the reign of Rameses II about midway through the thirteenth century B.C., why is there no record of this marvellous defeat in any Egyptian text or inscription?   Of course, the defeat may have been so embarrassing to Egypt that, like many great powers, it could not allow itself to record honestly what happened.    Alternatively, the story of the drowning of Pharaoh’s army may have been inflated over time by Hebrew oral tradition, and what had been a minor skirmish in Egyptian eyes (we know, for instance, that Ramses II died not in a watery grave but in his bed) was eventually puffed up beyond all recognition.  Most radically:  the Exodus may never have taken place, but may be just a story concocted, like Gilgamesh, by nomadic herdsmen in need of an evening’s entertainment.    This last hypothesis, though temptingly unambiguous, can be maintained only by ignoring  undeniable aspects of the actual text of the Bible.    There are real differences—literary differences, differences of tone and taste, but, far more important, differences of substance and approach to material—between Gilgamesh and Exodus, and even between Gilgamesh and Genesis.\"\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"\"The anonymous authors of Gilgamesh tell their story in the manner of a myth.  There is no attempt to convince us that anything in the story ever took place in historical time.   At every point, rather, we are reminded that the action is taking place “once upon a time”—in other words, in that pristine Golden Time outside of meaningless earthly time.   The story of Gilgamesh, like the gods themselves, belong to the realm of the stars.   It is meant as a model for the hearers, who believed, in any case, that everything important, everything archeteypal, happened, had happened, was happening—it is impossible to fix this occurrence clearly in one tense, since it occurs outside of time—beyond the earthly realm of unimportant instances.   For all the ancients (except the Israelites, the people who would become the Jews), time as we think of it was unreal; the Real was what was heavenly and archetypal.  For us, the heirs of the Jewish perception, the exact opposite is true:  earthly time is real time; Eternity, if we think of it at all, is the end of time (or simply an illusion).     The text of the Bible is full of clues that the authors are attempting to write history of some sort....But there is in these tales a kind of specificity—a concreteness of detail, a concern to get things right—that convinces us that the writer has no doubt that each of the main events he chronicles happened.”    \n",

If you are still upset or need validation must be easier ways of getting it than from me. But if that's all you want. You're a simple man. And I hope you god grants you it. I am being really serious guy. Why would I want to annoy. I'd much prefer annoying some twat with a hand grenade. But I don't expect any validation from anyone for that. I just want to see my girl.

The test is especially useful for players of sports like rugby, soccer, Australian rules football, hockey, netball, handball, tennis, squash and fitness testing at schools and colleges plus many other sports; employed by many international sporting teams as an accurate test of Cardiovascular fitness, one of the all-important \"\"Components of Fitness\"\". This test is also part of the FITNESSGRAM - Commercial Link, incorrect and unrelated to the Multi-stage Fitness Test physical fitness test to measure cardiorespiratory - Typo fitness. The test was created by Luc Leger, University of Montreal[1] published in 1983, \"\"A Maximal Multistage 20m Shuttle Run Test to predict VO2 Max\"\", and was re-published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology (vol 49 pp 1–12) in 1988 in its present form with 1 min stages under the name \"\"Multistage 20-m shuttle run test for aerobic fitness\"\".[2] Result equivalences between slightly modified versions are well explained by Tomkinson et al. in 2003.[3] The beep test world record is 19.2, held by Håkan Mild.[4][unreliable source?] - Embedded Commercial Link LAZYRUNNER added as Reference\n",

As this has been occuring here lately. First removal of 'unwanted', though referenced material without any source given, then questining the same material, and then deleting it altogether. When this kind of systematic destruction of my contributions was repeatadly, about 20 times a day occurs, I naturally reverted 'editions' which had nothing in them but tendentious deleting of text and replied to lowly tactics which degenerated to talk page to accusations and lies. I also observe with disgust - after such preceeding behaviour displayed - the hypocrite complaining to wiki administrators by the same persons. It takes two to dance.   \"\n",

For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14\"\", “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?   Then “BlackPearl14\"\", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14\"\", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14\"\", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.\n",

Scott, i think that is evidence that you still just don't get it.  this has nothing to do with string theory.  string theory is non-sequitur.  i hardly understand string theory (really, just the pop stuff Brian Greene puts on Nova), but i fully understand the argument that, in reality, the only physical quantities that we measure, that we perceive, that make any difference to anything that involves us as human beings (or E.T. beings, for that matter) are dimensionless quantities.  when something changes that affects us, ultimately it's a dimensionless measure, usually the ratio of like dimensioned quantities.  we always measure a dimensionful quantity against another like dimensioned quantity.\n",

      "if  changed (let's say got bigger), conceptually, that would have meaning, the electromagnetic force (relative to the other fundamental interactions) would have changed in proportion (gotten a little bigger).  then it would appear that the charge of an electron has gotten a little bigger (but it might not have) or that Planck's constant has gotten a little smaller (but it might not have) or that the speed of light has gotten a little smaller (that's the choice you and authors such as Moffat made) or even (if we're gonna say that  might have changed) that the permittivity of free space has changed (like ,  is defined in many measurement systems, such as SI or cgs).  (i doubt anyone will argue that it's  or  that has changed.)  heck, someday soon (i would expect within a decade)  will be defined (because of a redefinition of the kilogram).  if they do that, then a change in  gets blamed on a change of , which still seems most natural to me, but that's my opinion.  even so,. if they did that to  and  was measured to have changed, i would not argue that all of the electrons and protons and positrons in the universe have somehow transferred charge.  i would say that they appear to have a different charge since their strength of their interaction has changed (which is fundamentally all a change in  can mean).  that is all we would know or could ever know.  to blame any conceptual change of  on a change of any of the dimensionful ingredients to it, is silly.  16:04, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n",

      " Sandstein apparently thinks that everything not being a compliment is ipso facto derogatory. There is also another possibility that hasn't crossed his mind: neutral. No English dictionary has (derogatory) or (offensive) label next to the definition of the word nationalist. However, in Sandstein's native language the word nationalist does have a derogatory undertone. Here is the link to the definition of Nationalismus in the most authoritative German dictionary (Duden), where it has a label (meist abwertend) which translates into English as \"\"mostly pejoratively\"\". In German it's used as a pejorative, in English it isn't and it belongs to the neutral register. I suspect that Sandstein mixed two entirely different usage contexts for otherwise related words with the same meaning, in two different languages.\n",
      " It was not my intention to make any kind of personal attack. If you look at my edit history you can see that my behavior has been nothing short of exemplary. I have never heard anyone complaining about being offended by calling them nationalist. More often than not, it is I who is on the receiving end of abuse which sometimes provokes abrasive responses. If someone said that they are offended I would've stopped.\n",
      " Sandstein's condescending comment about me apparently failing to understand something (what?), justifying the \"\"educational\"\" component of the block by such lack of understanding is borderline insulting. Perhaps Sandstain trains his dog by taking punitive measures when puppy does something wrong, but may I remind him that we're dealing with human actors here that are not Fachidioten with blinders that only respond to Pavlovian stimuli dispensed by the master with his block^Wstick. An administrator should not be making such comments when blocking other users. They shouldn't probably be thinking of editors as offenders that ought to be subject to corrective measures (blocks) for their infractions (policy violations), but at least they could keep it to themselves.\n",
      " OK, let's say I crossed the line with nationalist name-calling. I didn't mean to use derogatorily, but I can accept that it is not an appropriate conduct. But what does that have to do with ARBMAC and the excessively long block? As I far I can see the guidelines on the WP:PA require posting a message on user's talkpage and seeking mediation. None of that happened. PA is a community-approved policy which takes precedence over anything ArbCom decides, or any admin \"\"broadly interprets\"\". A week is something that trolls and bad-faith editors get. Surely it's too excessive?\n",
      " This whole circus is a result of content dispute with the user who submitted the enforcement request. It was not made in good faith and his ulterior goal is to remove me from editing a set of low-importance articles that are currently not in a NPOV state. He also submitted a sockpuppet investigation against me with evidence such as last-year's sarcastic comment of mine on a sister project, as well as edits that I made years ago. With all that in mind, I must say that Wikipedia community has become very effective at giving partisan editors tools to target undesirable editors - a Byzantine collection of policies which admins overzealously enforce without a second thought, and without thinking of a big picture. Admins in fact are incentivized not to involve themselves, which basically gives the enforcement gun to POV-pushers which are intimately acquainted with all the glorious details of the relevant wikilese. I urge admins to think outside the policy-enforcing request-observing mode and think whether blocking me in any way helps to resolve the pending content disputes.   \"\n",

The image is a little washed out, but not to the extent that it is meant to be portraying a the yellow/gold/orange scheme - It is actually pink! I made a note about this on the 1-11 talk page but maybe you didn't see it. Though the yellow scheme was probably the best known, as it was used on their first TriStar G-BAAA, they had three other funky schemes which were used across the rest of the fleet - green bands, pink bands (also used on the second L-1011), and purple bands. They used to be a cheerful sight flying over our school in hemel hempstead when I was a kid - always turned my head to watch whenever they went over, though the 1-11s in particular were hard to avoid as they were so noisy! Airliners nowadays are a lot better, but also a lot more boring, and that goes for the colour schemes of the airlines too.  23:54, 18 Oct 2003 (UTC)\n",

      "Comment - 'Station' as a word essentially means 'a fixed point'.  I'm not sure of the exact definition in the past, but it pre-dates railways by several centuries.  'Battle stations' as a term dates back some considerable way, and naval vessels in their correct patrol areas were said to be 'on station' in Nelson's time.  I believe it is derived from a Latin word meaning 'still' (i.e. 'stationary').  'Railway station' as a term goes back at least as far as 1825, while 'train station' was not recorded for over a century after that, nor were 'petrol station', 'power station' or 'bus station'.  One important consideration is how widespread a term is.  Is it a 'railway station' in Australia, India, South Africa or any other country where the British built the railways?  Finally, the term 'train' may be incorrect when referring to modern passenger railway vehicles.  Under some definitions, trains are exclusively loco-hauled or push-pull.  Most modern passenger vehicles are multiple units, and thus not 'trains' under these definitions, because there is no locomotive.128.240.229.3\n",

One thing though: how would you distinguish between a Motswana (person from Botswana) and any member of the Tswana ethnic group - one fifth of the people of Botswana are NOT ethnic Batswana (many are Khoisan, white, other Bantu tribes...) and about 2/3 of ethnic Batswana live in South Africa. This justifies a word 'Botswanan', whose meaning is at least obvious to any English speaker, and will continue to be used whether the Batswana it or not.

      "Squeakbox's allegations about Nazism and editing a Rastafarian page (to the best of my recollection I have never been to such a page  my knowledge about Squeakbox's Rastafarian sympathies came from his own Wikipedia page)are nothing short of libelous and outrageous.  Obviously he has never read my work.  Most likely he is unfamiliar with the extremely readable and scholarly books of James Webb on occultism, including Nazi permutations of same.  Nazism was clearly based on occultism  evident in every respect from the Thule Society and Theosophical Society roots to the swastika itself.  Hitler did not take his notions from a vaccuum  his notions of \"\"cleansing actions\"\", \"\"master races\"\" and \"\"aryanism\"\" were standard fare in all occult reading  both of Rosicrucians and Theosophists.  As far as left hand swastikas and right hand swastikas are concerned, there are ample books (many of which are in my personal library) showing that it was used interchangeably both ways in both occult and Indian cultures.  The Jews were singled out for hatred in most such literature and still are in the books published by Lucis Trust / Lucis Publishing Company.  Just look at the indexes (and you can do free internet searches):  \"\"Judaism:  evils of\"\"; \"\"Judaism, need for dissolution of\"\".  I have BATTLED Nazism and racism all of my life, starting at age 4 when I told an aunt, \"\"that man's not bad because he wants to move in your neighborhood.  You're bad because you want to move out just because he's moving in . . .\"\"  Squeakbox owes me an apology.  He confesses he flunked logic.  He also confesses to a closed head injury with a machete type instrument.  For that, I will give him in good Christian style, a charitable interpretation and hope to think that these are his honest interpretations.  Read the New Age books CAREFULLY and not in an altered state  you will find that they are not all peace, light love.  And people who come against them are not \"\"Nazis\"\"  the kernel of Nazism is the occultism which in its essence spells doom to all who are not blonde, blue-eyed pagans in its ultimate world view.  I have many a New Age book from the early 1980s in my vast personal collection which tells Orientals, Africans, etc., that they should be practicing celibacy as their races are destined to die out anyway.  As regards Solana, he is smart enough to see the Club of Rome agenda for what it clearly is  a global population reduction and occult indoctrination program.

      "I think the intitial problem here is a WIkiepdia-old ownership issue - the very language Parrot of Doom uses gives this away. Although I agreed with his revert in this case (there are better ways present the fact of Griffin's well known bigotry than just to define him a 'bigot'), when I read his \"\"biased garbage\"\" edit note I was appalled at both the rudeness and politics, and planned to warn him myself tonight. As with myself, Nfitz is an experienced editor (from 2005 in his case, 2006 in mine). Also, I am VERY worried about Parrot's real stance on far right issues, despite what he says about Griffin on his user page. It’s an unfortunate truth that many people who so foolishly support the BNP just want certain policies and issues to made more public, and are not at all Griffin fans. I hope people can digest that comment. The BNP are also very, very clever, and without question far right – so I think we are all entitled to be wary of them from a Human Rights stance, whatever some people might insist about dotting each ‘i’ of the WP:AGF policy. Parrot has reacted to edits in this manner before, and if he (or anyone else) does it again I won't hesitate to make an official complaint, both on the rudeness and bias in the content.\n",

      "No matter what friends you make on Wikpedia, people like Slim Virgin (and others complementary of the trimming of likely problems from the Griffin article in time for Question Time) won't be stupid enough to defend totally uncalled-for civility indiscretions to time-served editors who are CLEARLY acting in good faith. Especially given the dangerous politics involved from one side only here, and considering what should be expected to happen from the middle ground with this article being so plainly lily-livered - about a terrifying political disease that so nearly destroyed Europe. They won't be so keen to line up, and will answer to people like me if they are too hasty. And Jews perhaps, Muslims, blacks - people like that? I'm still reeling from the 'mainstream' introduction I saw here last Thursday. I insist the BNP could not have come up with a better article themselves, as any showing less of their true values would hardly pass. The article had 100,000 hits (obviously - how can we be surprised about that?) and single-handedly proved right the nationally-made argument on why Griffin should not have been invited to the TV show: the irresponsible media (mainly Wikipedia, alas) will be able to casually present Griffin as a standard mainstream politician. And all in the name of supposed damage-limitation to Wikipedia's own credibility. \n",

Any argument that says prospective far right voters (if I'm actually allowed to use that term 'far right'?) can cleverly ‘read between lines’ - or even bother to read to the end of articles - is simply fully naive. Besides, the introduction is king with the reader, as it summerises what is below it. The majority of BNP supporters are THE most vulnerable people in Britain – and often the least educated. Wikipedia consistently ignores both the reader and the subject in its self-providing calculations, and with this deliberately damage-limited article (to put it most politely), it has manifestly helped to ‘rubber stamp’ fascism in the UK. A lot of people (esp non-Europeans) won’t know what that means, but many of us would agree that Wikipedia can scarcely have had a lower day.   \"\n",

I was wondering if you could put in context your own level of knowledge in chemistry, so that the articles can be reeditted to be applicable to your own level of knowledge. With the chemical reaction stubs, I have been assuming that people will generally be looking at them  if they have a basic level of chemical knowledge (i.e. one of about an A-Level student in England) and will not need a full explanation of why the reaction proceeds as it does. If this does not fulfil your ideals what else will I need to add, complete mechanisms with comments of facial and stereo selectivities and such. If so this is simply not possible as there will be a large amount of repeated information on Wikipedia. Please get back to me on this topic. - \n",

It is more appropriate that if you wish to include a subjective statement like \"\"Babaei was \"\"notorious for his merciless treatment of the pilots and officers\"\" considered disloyal to the new regime\"\", you include some background info on who made that statement (add more context). The word \"\"merciless\"\" is very subjective (opinion based) and if it is to be used you can't use it as if it was fact based, when you say \"\"Babaei was notorious for his merciless treatment of the pilots and officers\"\" you are making a strong statement about him that makes it seem as if it is a 100% true fact that he was merciless.\n",

Obviously, Motion 162 infringes Section 1b.  Section 1b. was in effect at the time this Resolution was presented.  Its clear that Adams made a mistake in procedure.  He should have sought a majority decision to amend Section 1b. in 1986 and returned in 1987 to propose entering Leinster House.

This change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of Section 1b in any way.  To discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it.  For example, conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it.  In fact the line Adams added in 1983 was superfluous, as the Sinn Féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.\n",

How else would one identify the Led Zeppelin album with the weird runes that some people label \"\"ZOZO\"\"? Beyond that, the rules become fuzzy very quickly (e.g., can one use a screencap to help identify significant commercials?), & I simply feel that those cases are not worth the effort to del with.

We could have weeks & weeks of fun deciding those cases.)

      "\n",
      "\"\"Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced\"\" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.\n",
      "During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book \"\"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia\"\", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that \"\"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek\"\" .\n",
      "\n",
      "The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.\n",
      "\n",
      "On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses a\n",

One such census is known to have occurred around the time that the birth of Jesus would have occurred. Secondly, Galilee would not have been exempt, since even virtually autonomous cities like Apamea in Syria were not exempt despite having almost complete self-governance. Thirdly, a Roman edict from G. Vibius Maximus (concerning a similar Roman census) says explicitly that citizens were required to return to their home town, just as it says in the Bible. Fourthly, the same edict says that each man had to bring his entire family with him, just as it says in the Bible.\n",

Some crucial pieces of information are obviously missing (particularly the plight of the city's inhabitants of Serbian nationality - about half of the total number - in the city subject to Croatian military rule, or the very existence thereof) parts of the text are clearly self-contradictory (the Croatian forces are claimed to be lightly armed, yet they still manage to down 20 warplanes) and full of dubious propaganda cliches (the backbone of JNA was broken at Vukovar). One does not need to be an expert on war in the Balkans to note these shortcomings.

People certainly could argue the Boogey Man/Trump segment was notable, as it featured the first time the 2 had interaction (or just on the fact Trump appeared).

You are saying being a backstage segment is the problem, so you wouldn't be objecting if they had done this on the stage or in the ring? If we mentioned them in the on screen talent section, what would we put down for them so someone else doesn't remove it.

      "First, until 3 weeks ago, I had never heard the term, \"\"meat puppet\"\".   Perhaps you're trying to make the term mean exactly what you want it to mean, no more and no less.  (Shades of Alice in Wonderland, I suppose.)  I will have to find the definition of that term.  But I view it as a problem when self-selected, biased individuals (even if there is no actual coordination involved) seem to coordinate their postings.  Dodo ran away, that's a fact.  He didn't address my actual criticisms of his actions:  he simply threw a few templates, as if that was the end of the argument.  (But, those templates were not merely mis-applied, they also did not address the entire subjects of the dispute.)  Dodo couldn't be bothered to address them, and for a 'good' (at least, for him!) reason:  If Dodo had to actually discuss his misconduct, and debate the propriety not merely of the original post, but also his own misdeeds, then Dodo would be so busy he couldn't continue his 'drive-by reversions' of peoples' articles.  Dodo was unwilling to explain why he deleted all of my edits, repeatedly.  He was unwilling to explain why he didn't wait for consensus.  Etc.\n",
      "And, it is a fact that 'nobody' addressed Dodo's (at least arguable) misconduct, even if (hypothetically) they also objected to something I did, too.  Why should that be?  There's an 'excellent' reason:  I think the kind of people who did post (self-selected, of course, one would expect) may very well have felt they were defending 'one of their own'.  I repeat my point that if I had time (and access to reversion/deletion statistics) it would probably be obvious that those persons who felt the need to speak up generally engaged in a pattern of activity similar to that of Dodo: Revert, Revert, Revert!   And, not to bother with any 'consensus'.  (\"\"We don't need no stinkin' consensus!\"\").  Such persons would be fearful of 'outing' Dodo's pattern of action, and similarly fearful of someday being hit with similar criticism.  Am I wrong?  I invite somebody else to study their statistics, and explain why there's no 'pattern' there.\n",

There are casualty figures in all the conflict, war, battle etc. Wiki articles I have referenced, why not this one? Thanks   \n",
      "RomaC, the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only, which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years. This article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity. The fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself. Here at Wikipedia, we value the ability to achieve consensus, and to be fair to many viewpoints. And believe it or not, we often do achieve that at the article Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were \"\"reliable,\"\" without addressing any of the underlying issues, or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused. \n",

      "To repeat: statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the article's lead. there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote, all in the name of objectivity, which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other. please note, this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus, rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus.   \n",

Please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliably-sourced and up-to-date civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war, battle or conflict is disingenuous. If you or any other editor want to add more statistics, covering a longer time period, then go ahead, but do not delete relevant content added by other editors. Yes, the edit \"\"sparked so much conflict and opposition\"\" but note also also that here at Wikipedia we do not determine what is \"\"fair\"\" through intimidation by numbers.

      "Opie, your statement \"\"You don't honestly believe that the author of the golf tee book is making things up\"\"…. is foolish. Many books and authors present fraudulent and construed information. Some of these authors print information that is researched haphazardly and sometimes not researched at all.  This is why reputable authors research and verify the content they use with Agencies that hold the fact-based and documented information. You consistently use the book The Singular History of the Golf Tee by Irwin R. Valenta, along with the website “Scottish Golf History” as a fact-based source. Looking at the website alone I find an abundance of erroneous and inaccurate information and patents. One just for example, is the U.S. patent of Mr. Dalziel in 1896. This patent, is claimed on the site as a “golf tee,” but in actuality is a device to be used in a game of Tennis and has no relation or bearing on the game of golf.  See patent #567,455 This is just one of the flagrant inaccuracies that are included in the links and information you have provided.  Another example of a site that has inaccurate information is Pat Ryan Golf timeline. It states that the Bloxsom & Douglas patent originated in 1899. Whether these “inaccuracies” are intentional or not, it is the lack of due diligence of the authors and originators that seems to be the issue.  Once corrected information has been verified and deemed accurate, upon the notification to the necessary parties, the erroneous information should be removed.  If it is not, then one is lead to believe that the misinformation by the author or originator is intentional. \n",

Since the SoP is a state occupied by Israel, arguments of the kind you are adducing do not apply. We do not underwrite power arrangements here, we simply state what the best sources agree is the case, which here, is that Jerusalem is not wholly in Israel, is occupied, and the occupied Palestinian part is more or less left to its own resources in managing the mess in its quarter. Since the article deals with all of the city, there's no way of equivocating over this, and trying to maintain NPOV while relegating the Palestinian fact to a footnote.\n",

      "and actor Leslie Howard to direct Pygmalion, and working with editor David Lean and actor/director Harold French to assist on Major Barbara. I don't think this style was a secret. The directing talent behind Pygmalion was decidedly Anthony Asquith, who went on to direct another Shaw play \"\"The Doctor's Dilemma\"\" in 1958, another success, showing it was his magic that turned Shaw's plays into cinema more than Pascal. Pascal's success was to gain the trust of Shaw and get him to grant concetions on the script. It was probably a mistake for him to direct \"\"Caesar and Cleopatra\"\" alone, most likely at Shaw's urging, as he didn't really have the director's skill so much as the art of the deal. But he was so afraid of losing Shaw that he most likely agreed to take total control to please Shaw. Sadly, had he kept Asquith, all his later attempts might have succeeded. Far from the megalomania that he is sometimes portrayed as, Pascal appears to have enjoyed deep collaboration, both with the playright, the directors, and the actors. Shaw came to think of Pascal as such a genius that he probably pushed him too far.  \"\n",

The parts of the villages in Syria's side is named as the Arabic of the Turkish name or the original Turkish name was protected but with Arabic spelling. This is valid for the new place of the tomb as well: Turkish Eşme (Esme) is in Turkey's side, Syrian Ashma is in Syrian side. Turkey transferred sovereignity of 10000 m2=0.01 km2 territory together with the tomb in Qaraqozak inside another place within Syria (i.e., Syrian Ashma; 200 m from Turkey-Syria border). The Turkish flag is raised in Ashma (200 m from the Turkey-Syria border). The corpses of Suleyman Shah is temporaly in Turkey.

From what I can tell, it is a historical truth that scientists (being the busy people they are) detest new science models. Many of the assumptions in physics we currently hold as truth took decades to overcome locked mindsets. For example, a huge number of physicists describe magnetic fields as an illusion, though there is no evidence supporting this conclusion and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from billions of electrons being ejected by the Sun every minute. \n",

      "Generally, a certain risk of local tissue damage is involved when using local anesthetics often and regularly during a longer period at a specific location of your body. For example, the chronic use of topical eye anesthetics in chronic eye pain would almost certainly and relatively quickly lead to serious eye damage (corneal damage).\n",
      "Before using local anesthetics, chronic local pain should not only carefully be assessed with medical specialists for the local problem (for example an ophtalmologist, dermatologist, dentist or a neurologist/specialist for peripheral nerve blocks), but also by specialists for centrally active pain medication.\n",
      " Medical specialists (ophtalmologists, dermatologists, dentists or neurologists for peripheral nerve blocks) for the local problem can assess how big the risk of chronically using local anesthetics at that particular location is.\n",
      " In most cases of chronic pain, it is not the peripheral nervous system but the central nervous system that is not able to cope with the pain impulses coming from the location in the peripheral nervous system where the damage that causes the pain is actually located. Therefore, medical specialists for the central nervous system (usually a neurologist or pain specialist) can assess if and what kind of centrally acting medication can or should be taken. Very often, it is less harmful and risky to use centrally active substances (especially when they are only taken in low doses) against chronic pain in the peripheral nerve system than chronically using local anesthetics at a particular location of the body. Relatively risk free, especially when taken in small doses, and at the same time often effective against chronic peripheral pain are antidepressants of the SSRI class and the stronger tricyclic antidepressants like for example amitriptyline. Furthermore, modern anticonvulsants like pregabalin or gabapentin are relatively risk free and at the same time relatively effective against chronic pain, at least when taken in very low or low doses. One of the strongest and more risky options in the reduction of peripheral pain are anticonvulsants like carbamazepine. On the other hand, some other classes of centrally acting substances like for example opioids (they are unfortunately still often used in the treatment of chronic pain, including local pain in the peripheral nerve system) are extremely harmful and should be avoided in the treatment of chronic pain at all costs.\n",

Unless you can find a secondary source showing that the Rolling Stones were using it to refer to the subculture, then you don't have a dispute.  We don't do original research.  The Fallon citation isn't sourced to Fallon: it's found in multiple sources that make that claim.  Take a look at the citation in the Hippie article: Perry 2005, p. 19; Sinclair, Mick. (2004) San Francisco: A Cultural and Literary History. Signal Books. p. 205. ISBN 1902669649; Singleton, Carl. Wildin, Rowena. (1999). The Sixties in America. Salem Press. p. 334. ISBN 0893569828; Stevens 1998, pp. 299-300; Tompkins 2001, vol. 7: 1960-1969.  Now, all you have to do is find one that refers to the Rolling Stones.

But as I've said if tagging the article with a wrong tag gives you joy then I won't interfere, be joyous my friend. I've invested a lot of time into that article, and it would be nice if you've found something you don't like to actually try and fix it instead of adding those maintenance templates, but I guess we are not all here on the same mission. Some are here apparently just to stubbornly diminish work of others. Even if proven wrong.  \"\n",

They always refer to their music as \"\"dance music\"\", although they get called a indie rock band. She Wants Revenge's genre has been discussed on their wikipage numerous times that they ARE Darkwave. Darkwave as a genre is not Industrial, as it is today, by itself it is New Wave Music with dark overtones, for example see The Frozen Autumn or Pink Turns Blue. The band takes huge influence from both new wave AND gothic rock, as well as other genres, but darkwave usually takes influence from other genres - so does Gothic rock. There's a huge difference. If it wasn't for She Wants Revenge's huge popularity there would be no doubt that She Wants Revenge is Darkwave.

      "\n",
      "I note that you reverted my replacement of Image:TTU Seal.svg, Image:TTUS Seal.svg and Image:TTUHSC Seal.svg with Image:Texas Tech CoA.png in their respective articles.  The reason I replaced them was twofold:\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, it simply seems to me that, at least for the TTU and TTUHSC articles (not so sure about TTUS) the Coat of Arms would more accurately reflect the overall visual identity of the institutions in question; according to the visual identity guidelines at , \"\"[t]he Official Seal and Signature are [...] reserved for use by the Office of the President of Texas Tech University and are used to represent the official business of the university\"\", whereas the academic Coat of Arms is intended as a \"\"unified identity for all academic entities within the Texas Tech University System\"\".  Using the Coat of Arms instead of the seals in our articles would also seem to reduce the (admittedly small) chance of them being mistaken for official documents of the university, and complies with the advice (which, while we are not bound by it under fair use, it would seem courteous for use to follow) that \"\"[t]he Official Seal and Official Signature may be used only for documents and publications that represent official business of Texas Tech University\"\" and that \"\"[d]ocuments that are not official and formal should use the appropriate Academic Signature\"\" (i.e. the Coat of Arms).  It also allows us to use a single image for all the articles, not to mention, in my opinion at least, showing the interesting part of the logo more clearly without the distracting border and text around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second, and more significant, reason for the replacement, however, was that, while I'd originally uploaded those SVG seal images in good faith, believing them to be acceptable with U.S. fair use law as well as our policies, upon further reflection I'm not longer as convinced of this as I was.  In particular, while there are reasons for arguing that the SVG versions are not too detailed to pass criterion 3(b), especially given that they're freely available from the TTU web site anyway, I now feel that, regardless of the acceptability of their absolute level of detail, they are nonetheless replaceable by less detailed bitmap images, and therefore fail the non-free content criterion 3(a).\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, I no longer believe those images are appropriate for Wikipedia, and do not want myself to be associated with them.  As their uploader, I have the right to delete them; the reason I chose to tag them as orphan instead of deleting them directly is that I wanted to keep them around for a while, in case someone did object to the change, and did not want others to end up tagging them (and warning me about it) while they were there.  That said, I still don't want them to stay around forever with my name in the upload log; if you want to, despite the issues I outlined above, you're free to reupload them (or bitmap versions of them) under a different title, thereby assuming the responsibility of asserting their compliance under our policies and U.S. law.  I no longer want that responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and regarding the use of the TTUHSC seal at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso Campus, I'm pretty sure that blatantly violates our non-free content criterion 8.  It's not like that article really needs (either of) the images, anyway.  —  \"\n",

It seems that writing any argument on Wikipedia is OK as long as it dosnt conflict with Damac's views.  He gives a link to a political debate site where I also posted the same argument.  Why should Wikipedia users be directed to a political debate site to read arguments that were composed for this site and then posted on the debate site.  That my composition was posted here on this site can be seen by checking the time of posting my argument here and checking the time I posted it on Politics i.e.  I think \"\"genuine Wikipedia\"\" users can make up their own mind about Damac's motives.

If it's possible to have more then the total, and more then the total are approved, how exactly are the states which will actually be on the council selected (e.g. based on the votes received).

These people play little games of waffling back and forth between demands for sources and, when they get sources, questions of relevance. (See Talk:State_terrorism for example.)  When their opponent suggests that they are being less than honest in doing so, these people block them for making personal comments.

There is a user name kapil.xerox who I have had issues with in the past regarding a group called BAPS. That user is trying to get me blocked again for this issue and accusing me of sock puppetry when I have not done anything wrong and trying to use my section blanking as evidence to block me because he disagrees with any criticism towards their group. In particular recently, for the article titled Akshardham Delhi (a monument made by BAPS  to), he recently popped out of no where to try to remove legitimate sourced by over a dozen environmental criticisms regarding the monument. Please see [[]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akshardham_(Delhi)] and the talk page . When I updated the books for the citations and added several more citations, he contacted another admin as you see here to  to remove me from Wikipedia. I believe this is not okay especially since this user has a severe conflict of interest in this subject who also was blocked when I was going through my issues.

      "If you are not yet sick of history merges, here's one that is a little strange.  This article Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Guns and Robots was developed up to a certain point in Feruary, then the changes pick up with the same editors at Guns and Robots (video game) until a few days ago, and a redirect was created at Guns and Robots pointing to this article.  Then a totally different editor, transferred all of the text to the redirect page and made a redirect out of the page which had been the article.  No reason given on the talk pages.  I personally feel that the pages were correct before the move, but I am not an expert on the conventions of page naming.  In any case, the history of Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Guns and Robots needs to be appended to Guns and Robots (video game), not to Guns and Robots as it would appear from a casual look.

The vandalism (e.g. \"\"more pictures\"\") is also out of hand.

      "You can't have it both ways. You're either an encyclopedic website that seeks to be factual and informative while minimizing speculation or you're a fansite. Either way, it's not suitable for inclusion. For example, if your site is a community run information site, then it should not be included under the In general, any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article here would have once it becomes an example of brilliant prose guideline. Your Wiki won't provide information we don't already have or will have in the future if its just a community info site. However, if it trades in information that we won't be adding, such as speculation, theories, spoilers, because of Wikipedia guidelines on such material, then we should not be posting your sites for the reasons discussed above. It is not the case of making a link between encyclopedias, but between an encyclopedia and one particular fansite.\n",
      "Further, the two Wikis you mention aren't even major fansites, when the guideline specifically states: Fan sites: On articles about topics with many fansites, including a link to one major fansite is appropriate, marking the link as such. In extreme cases, a link to a web directory of fansites can replace this link. We already have the major AND official forum: The Fuselage. If you'd like to add a link to a directory of Lost fansites, be my guest... but inclusion of either Wiki alone (instead of a list) is preferential treatment of minor fansites, since there are certainly other, larger, more popular fansites (Lost-media, Lost-tv, for example). Certainly, if we were to start adding fansites at random, we'd have to begin there and with others, like a link to TWOP's reviews and forums. The best course of action if you believe these sites simply must be linked to is for you to make a list of fansites and include a link to that directory, which is how WP:EL says to proceed.\n",
      "As for removing the disclaimer, its not going anywhere. The disclaimer was put there specifically because we'd have people posting each and every fansite they dreamed up as official sites when they weren't. Lost is an example of a show wherein Wikipedia guidelines and policies are repeatedly ignored by the editing community, so the long-term editors have had to be very diligent in monitoring this page. This is an outgrowth of that, and has for the most part helped a lot. Moreover, there is no \"\"freebie\"\" section for links. All links listed there are official sources except IMDB, which is used almost without exception. The same list of reasons I mentioned above for IMDB, including the fact that IMDB is a featured part of the standard TV Infobox, clearly do not apply to these Wikis nor any other site people have been trying to add (Mr. Clucks, 4815162342, etc.)\n",
      "Finally, I will agree with you that the list of links for all the individual networks is redundant, and should be chopped down or moved to Airdates of Lost as a link for the country/network listed there.  \"\n",
