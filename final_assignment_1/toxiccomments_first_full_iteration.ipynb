It's not much, but the author's an expert on Kent DB, and given the obscurity of the place and DB's way of referring to many places I counted myself lucky! ;o) Maybe the sentence could read \"\"An analysis of the archbishop's holdings in Domesday Book has concluded that All Saints was among them\"\"?

The family includes a grandfather, Ahmed Yussif and his 2 orphaned grandchildren: Fatima Banda and Tijani Suleman. The grandfather just had a stroke about a week ago and is in a hospital. Their home address is: Plot 78, block X, Kronum Kwapra. The phone number I have is: 233-247-148310. Is there anyone who can call on them and show some support to the family? Find out which hospital he is in and have prayer with them. The grandfather has lost his speech but can whisper some. I would appreciate any help you can give to them. I feel close to the family but i am too far away to help. All I can do from here is continue to pray for them.\n",

The only magazine article I can think of is that (in)famous Nick Kent \"\"The Face\"\" 1985 article on The Smiths. There are also a few pages about her in \"\"The Severed Alliance\"\", but it's similar stuff as in that Ludus biography you posted the link to, plus some interesting quotes by Richard Boon and Trotter. Apparently her flat in Whalley Range was sort of a bohemian haven for many musicins and artists. They also claim she had quite an influence over men in her circle, that Pete Shelley wrote Buzzcocks' 'What Do I Get' as a plea of unrequited love for her, and that she inspired a lot of Devoto's early work. Her name also pops up a lot in \"\"Songs That Saved Your Life\"\" - besides Cemetry Gates, she's mentioned in entries for Miserable Lie, Wonderful Woman, Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me (in connection to a weird matrix message that was initially supposed to be on the single) and I Won't Share You. In the latter, there's another quote from the unused Morrissey sleeve note for the cancelled Crepuscule Ludus restrospective - the end of the note sounds very familiar: \"\"Oh Linder. Oh Linder. I'll see you sometime, somewhere.\"\" \n",

      "Actually, my goal is to make a neutral POV present in these articles, which involves removing the biased edits made by you two users. You have both consistently  made very controversial and unfounded edits in this and similar articles based on your own agenda, yet you accuse others of doin the same without acknowledging your own ridiculous POV edits. I am not denying the link between Iberia and the British Isles but it is the same link shared across western and atlantic Europe and there is no special relationship with regards to those two respective regions. The relationship is only based on the Y-chromosome and Mtdna inheritance shared with all Western European regions. It needs to be reminded that there are subgroups to the r1b Y-chromosome marker and the regions have differential values in both y-chromosomes and mtdna. There is very little to no evidence of autosomal and x-chromosome analysis, and when viewing the y-chrom./mtdna percentages in these populations you need to look at them as a whole. R1b is found across western Europe in high frequencies, but it does not mean the populations are necessarily very related to each other. There is no genetic evidence yet of a Neolithic link between the British Isles and Iberia since R1b traces back to a Paleolithic Iberian refuge. The Neolithic and following periods were quite different between the Iberian and the British Isles and the Neolithic Y/chrom. and Mtdna percentage is much larger in Iberia than in Britain or Ireland. You also must not rely so significantly on references by Sykes or Oppenheimer since they have not brought any new genetic evidence to the subject and only cite studies in their books that have already been out for quite some time and are already found cited in these articles. I've read through both books and they really do make hasty, unfounded and biased conclusions that do not necessarily coincide with the results of the studies they refer so much to. There are also books already out, and also some to be released in the following months, which  contradict and refute many of the \"\"findings\"\" or \"\"conclusions\"\" of Oppenheimer and Sykes. Their views are also a minority among population geneticists and anthropologists because the majority acknoledge that many more studies on all sections of DNA need to be carried out to fully understand the origins of various peoples, let alone declaring any solid conclusions or findings. I do agree that I should discuss my edits when I make them and I will endeavour to do so from now on so it is easier to compromise on the fidings in this article.  \"\n",

As you can find out that any good thing which comes from India is not real Indian / Aryan / Hindu but is imported from outside to India and we Indians are basterd offsprings from that .No new to we!! The great Alfanso Mangos are not local from Konkan region but are brought to India by the Portugies and such other numerious theories put in this new world firstly by the British and later by Amiricanus. Brother Iranians i have read little history of Iran. As we all know that originaly all Iranians befoure the birth of Islam were not muslims but Aryan as the word Iran itself stands for littrley as the dewwlling of Aryans outside mainland India. And what happned when the Arabs now converted to Islam attacted to Iran ?? Were the gret Iranians who now boast that they are the creator and founder of this wrestling art able to protect the own country and ther religion ?? No!! No!!. And to escape from this attct wher the Iranians flead ?? Even to China !! O.K NOW TELL ME WE Aryans/ Marathas / Hindus / Indians fought 1000 years to Islamic invision and reuled and 200 years of British rule and now where are we and where are those grate Mughals/ Brtish / Afghans/ Pakistanis/ Turks / ETC . Thre truth is that we Aryans / Marathas / Hindus / Indians not only surveyed but overcome this invision and eat those invaders and will eat in feauter.

I have seen those WWF entertienment on cable TV sINCE 1992 and from the begining i was desliking to this Americanus beggares play. But in reality in my surrounding i have observerd great wrestlers and seen how much respect our Maratha society gives to these wrestlers.The traditional Maratha wrestling and wrestler has many sides and aspects , i will discuss it later but any way one can understand it if he is clever.Allthough these Indian wrestler are not successful in international competations such as Olympics , But if you see the ecomomic and weather conditions of India you may find the answer.In our Maratha society wrestiling is a good social title and way of life such as Docters and other professionals.   I use to workout and do exircise when i was in school and college and aimes to earn great body.

      " Hi there! Thank you for your querie about the Humanistic teachings of Nichiren Buddhism. Let me start by saying that the title \"\"Humanistic Buddhism\"\" is rather sematically weak: because there are no 2 types of Buddhism: one Humanistic and another non-Humanistic. I think we should alter the title into \"\"Buddhist Humanism\"\". If you trace the word Humanism you'll find various views: Christian Humanism, secular Humanism...etc... and adding the term \"\"Buddhist Humanism\"\" is appropriate. \n",
      "\n",
      " Secondly, the term Humanistic Buddhism or Buddhist Humanism, whether in China or Japan or the USA, is based on the Buddha's teachings - in particular the teachings of the Lotus Sutra. (The article mentions this clearly). The Lotus Sutra - of course - is not a private property of a certain temple or nation (Chinese, Japanese etc...) Buddhism of the Lotus Sutra is a universal teaching for all Humanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, it was TienTai of China who placed the Lotus Sutra as the highest of the Buddha's teachings. Later it was introduced to Japan and the Tendai Sect emerged upholding the Lotus teachings, which was the ground for Nichiren, who appeared in 1222, to declare his teachings based solely on the Lotus Sutra. Currently, a 12 millions Samgha Nichiren Buddhist group (the Soka Gakkai International) is actively working for: \"\"Spreading Buddhist Humanism in the Community\"\" http://www.sgi.org/about-us/members-stories/spreading-buddhist-humanism-in-the-community.html\n",

      "Buddhist Humanism: http://www.daisakuikeda.org/main/philos/buddhist/buddh-05.html\n",
      "\n",
      " I think it is more accurate and more professional to refer to Buddhism as either Theravada or Mahayana. In China or Japan, you have Buddhist schools which are either Theravada or Mahayana. There is no such thing as \"\"Chinese\"\" Buddhism and \"\"Japanese\"\" Buddhism. Using the term Chinese or Japanese Buddhism is plainly wrong. For example Zen has branches and temples in both Japan & China. It remains Zen. No need here for confusing \"\"passport\"\" added to Buddhism. Nichiren Buddhism is found all over the world but mostly parcticed in Japan, this does not make it Japanese, but correctly: a Mahayana school based on the Lotus Sutra. It is even not logical to speak about Humanism and Humanity and in the same time restrict Buddhism to artificial national descriptions of  Chinese and Japanese terms. \n",

I disagree and say that the reporters and anchors who reported the story were well aware that this was a joke and that debunking it was simply part of the satire. \"\"Debunking\"\" a time traveler is POV. And if it is satire it is clearly intentional unreliability. Reporting what something appears to be is a pseudoscience. Every year many news sources have \"\"Special Issues\"\" on April 1st. There is an understanding that on that date many pranks may be pulled. We laugh and then forget the jokes the next day, in my opinion. Orson Welles' \"\"War of the Worlds\"\" broadcast is notable because (amongst other things) of the widespread panic that it caused by people who literally believed it to be a reliable news item. I don't think that any of these people \"\"went along with the fun, wink wink, nudge nudge, and fled their homes just for the snicker bragging rights\"\". No such notable hysteria came of this story, as I had already shown that since the initial flash in the pan 2 months ago this has been mentioned only once by any news source. Charlie Chaplin's The Circus is not the point, it never has been. The point is seeing how far a joke can be stretched for the snickering fun of it. The Circus, or a few seconds from an extra feature on its DVD over 80 years after it was made, its itself arbitrary to the joke itself. How then does this help the wikipedia article for The Circus? -   \"\n",

If you choose the latter, editors are allowed to run free and the project grows quickly.  However, you can end up with long, protracted debates between editors about seemingly trivial points.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dear \"\"Ezhava\"\" friends, I am a 6th Dan Black Belt in Shoto-Khan ( Karate ) and also having 2 Degrees in both Kalarippayattu (Vadakkan Style) and Shawolin Kung-fu ( Wing Chun Style ).. hailing from an Orthodox Chekava Ezhavar family in north Malabar, and also a Master in Law (M.L.M) and have been practicing in High Court . Our family is one of the reputed Chekava families in Kerala and trainers of \"\"Kalarippayattu\"\" for centuries. And according to our family sayings our family was the leading \"\"Kalari\"\"(the temple for training \"\"Kalarippayattu\"\")  in kerala for training \"\"Vadakkan Style\"\" & \"\"Thekkan Style\"\". And hear that when Nairs and all came to Kerala, they were very poor and good in character and were the servants of \"\"Namboothiri-Brahmin-Caste\"\" .One thing we are very proud with to tell that, even centuries before the arrival of \"\"Brahmins\"\" & \"\"Nairs\"\" to kerala, here our ancestors had made this martial art of \"\"Kalarippayattu\"\" well disciplined one and practiced with all of its systematized weaponry methods. At that time, we used the word \"\"Kalari\"\" to mean the \"\"training place\"\" from which word the name \"\"Kalarippayattu\"\" was derived. After nairs had come here, \"\"Nairs\"\" also started to study \"\"Kalarippayattu\"\" from our kalari traditions under strict disciplines. Like the same...\"\"Muslims\"\" and \"\"Chritians\"\" also started mastering in \"\"the kalarippayattu\"\" from \"\"Chekava Ezhavar\"\" families.You can see so many \"\"Christian & Muslim\"\" kalari experts also in the history. It doesn't mean that the \"\"kalarippayattu\"\" was brought from Arabia. The \"\"Nairs\"\" also came here some centuries back. But it had been a cultural martial orthodox tradition that was related to the blood of Malabar region as a part of its hereditary Chekava Society. But the shameless \"\"Nair Society\"\" after coming here and after studying the tricks and techniques from the people inhibited here ..now would like to teach the world that they are the main practitioners of this martial art even when this martial art has been practiced here for thousands of years by the other people in this region. If so \"\"Muslims&Christians;\"\" also can start claiming that it was brought here from Arabia.    But when the \"\"Brahmins (Namboothiris) started getting donations ( \"\" Dhanam\"\") like lands, golds, and so many things in other kind..from the rulers from our castes in ancient times  , \"\"Brahmins\"\" became landlords. \"\"Nairs\"\" also became \"\"Rich\"\" gradually when the nairs started a cheap system called \"\"Sambandham\"\"(a system of giving Nair Women to any rich traveller people in their way like \"\"Namboothiri\"\" for using that woman for a short period of time comparing to marriage,  to obtain and to posses the lands,houses and their other assets held by those traveler / Namboodhiris. I saw in the wikipedia website that, this system was stopped by social reformers playing humiliating public Dramas in front of them with the help also of Gentle Nair Men.Because it was a system like which we cant see ever in the history or ever in the world even in the people inhabiting in jungles ).In the modern world, it is not called as \"\"sambandham\"\" but we use some other words to denote these types of cultures. The same shameless system what they used to obtain \"\"Brahmin's\"\" assets, now they use to obtain the reputation regarding \"\"Kalarippayattu\"\". What the ancestors of the \"\"Nairs\"\" did \n",
      "was not a problem of \"\"Ezhavar\"\". It was just the problem of their ancestors. We don't want to feel guilty conscious in their cultural tragedy. We don't want to discuss about their past, but what makes us this much angry is their intolerance in others traditional supremacy and brutal nature to destroy our public records because of jealousy. Should we attack \"\"Nair\"\" websites in return of it?..\"\"NO\"\". We don't want to attack others. But what we want to do is we want to grow ourselves and we want to let others also to grow. This is our tradition. We don't want to attack others and we don't want to posses other's assets/cultures. And in one another point of view we can be proud also. Because even though these castes trying to include us under their  Varna System we should know that we are just above of all of these systems and , when the \"\"Brahmins\"\" came to this place, our ancestors could  give them enough Land and Accommodations and Houses considering they are \"\"Brahmins\"\". That is why the \"\"Brahmins\"\" use the word \"\"ILLAM\"\" for their houses.Because, actually the word \"\"ILLAM\"\" meant for the houses of \"\"Ezhavar\"\". Still the historical word \"\"ILLAM\"\" is used for \"\"Ezhava Houses\"\". As the \"\" Nairs\"\" were the workers of \"\"Namboothiris\"\" they also received some shares from the donations through \"\"Namboothiris\"\" and also by \"\"Sambandham\"\".

First of all, Oscar Schindler was a true hero who saved thousands of people from imminent death by risking his life in the heart of the Nazi Germany. With no unintended disrespect for Mr.Winton, he merely sat in his hotel room and wrote ads to newspapers. Secondly, Schindler's heroism is widely recognized all over the world, while Winton is mostly known by the British who are extremely well-known for loudly bragging about things they never accomplished. He is a purely media-made hero. And third of all, the children he saved were thrown out of their homes in Britain as soon as the war ended. And judging by the numerous published cases of abuse of evacuated British children in their adoptive homes, how those Czechoslovakian children were treated in their British homes would be an interesting investigation. So I completely agree with the anonymous user. Any comparisons between those two people should be removed from the article.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hello. Could you please stop by Talk:Christianity and give your opinion? We are debating whether the word 'monotheism' should be included in the intro to the Christianity article. According to most dictionaries, the definition of monotheism is The dogma or belief that there is one God. Now, all Christians believe there is one God and all Christian creeds (such as the Nicene Creed and Chalcedonian Creed) profess a belief in one God. The point of contention is the Holy Trinity. Christians believe that God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit all make up one [[Ousia|essense] of God, i.e. are three parts of one God (known as hypostasis). Now, several editors think that because this is different from the Islamic view of Tawhidand they alledge Muslims think Christians are not monotheistic, but [[tritheistic]we cannot say Christianity is monotheistic like is done in the Islam article. Many editors content, however, that the definition of monotheism is based solely on belief, not truth. So if Christians believe their God is one God, they are by definition monotheistic, even if they may not be right. All it takes to be monotheistic is to believe there is one God. Others, however, think we can only say \"\"Christianity is a monotheistic religion according to its followers.\"\" Again, some editors (including myself) have issue with this because it's basically like saying \"\"Christianity believes it believes that there is one God,\"\" which of course is redundant. In my opinion, monotheism by definition is the belief! None-the-less, we would like to know from a Muslim editor: 1) Do Muslims view Christianity as tritheistic? 2) If so, does this view affect that fact that Christians think their God is one God (even though they may not be right), and if not, aren't Christians by definition monotheistic?

      "\n",
      "1. \"\"Smith's earliest religious experiences, which involved heavenly visions and visitations, the use of seer stones to obtain obscure knowledge and to locate buried treasure, were not uncommon where Smith lived, and the fashionably elite Protestant clergy of the area were not impressed by Smith's early visions and divinations, but neither were they likely surprised or alarmed\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a couple problems with the above.  First, whether seer stones were used by others to obtain obscure knowledge particularly \"\"where Smith lived.\"\"  (I'll explain why I think that's important later.)  Second, whether Joseph used \"\"the\"\" seer stones (Urim and Thummim) to locate buried treasure, and whether such efforts were religious experiences (to him they were not).  (To my knowledge his treasure hunting efforts were limited to the time prior to obtaining the Urim and Thummim.)  Third, whether the \"\"fashionably elite Protestant clergy\"\" (whatever that means, which probably needs changing) were not impressed by the early visions and divinations (and subsequently not surprised or alarmed).  This claim should either a) be removed for its lack of verifiability, or b) be augmented by the remarks that Joseph himself makes as a first-hand witness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I honestly don't have a recommended alternative.  The entire paragraph is fairly ripe for discussion in my opinion.  Just to recap:\n",
      "\n",
      "a. Whether the use of seer stones was restricted to Joseph's residential area.\n",
      "b. Whether treasure hunting was a religious experience for him.\n",
      "c. i. Whether the term \"\"fashionably elite\"\" is remotely relevant to the article.\n",
      "c. ii. Joseph's own recount of clergy response should be included at the very least.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"\"the Burned-over district of western New York where Joseph Smith, Jr. was raised\"\" is facially inaccurate.  Joseph spent the first ten years of his life in Vermont, with only four years in New York prior to the First Vision. I suggest the following rewording of the second half of the entire sentence:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"that campaign also took place in the Burned-over district of western New York where Joseph Smith, Jr. had lived for four years.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. \"\"Nevertheless, Mormon extrapolations regarding Jesus are in many ways more similar to the earliest Christian heresies.\"\"  A rather strong claim , and I don't mind keeping it in, but it should be on the following conditions:\n",
      "1. \"\"earliest\"\" be quantified to a given year, and \"\"Christian\"\" quanitified to a sect of the time.\n",
      "2. We add the following text from Hugh Nibley's \"\"The World and the Prophets,\"\" which tells of a time when current generally-accepted Christian beliefs were heresies:\n",
      "\"\"Ignatius of Antioch writes to the Trallians: 'There are some Christ-betrayers... They introduce God as being unknown.' And to the Smyrnaens he says: 'Do ye, therefore, mark those who preach other doctrines, how they affirm that the Father of Christ cannot be known.\"\" (page 55)\n",
      "\"\"The great crime of the heretics in general, according to the Apostolic Constitutions, is 'that they blaspheme God by saying that he is unknowable and not the Father of Christ...but is indescribable, unutterable, unnamable, self-begotten...'\"\" (page 55)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. \"\"Mormon followers of Brigham Young generally believe in Young's doctrine that Jesus was \"\"born\"\" into a \"\"spirit body\"\", like the rest of humanity, and remained in that state until his Incarnation.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The word incarnation doesn't fit the context of the sentence, and I'd prefer to discuss Mormonism here.  I recommend we change that to say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"The branch of Mormonism lead by Brigham Young teaches that Jesus was \"\"born\"\" into a \"\"spirit body,\"\" like the rest of humanity, and remained in that state until his mortal birth.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5. \"\"He claimed to have received revelation only after asking questions about a subject, pondering, and praying to God for an answer.

More precisely, we tend to edit out misconceptions about Mormon beliefs.  For example, I'm not sure where you got the idea that we believe that elephants once roamed North America or that American Indians were descended from the Jewish race.  The word elephant appears once in the english version of the Book of Mormon, but that may or may not refer to what we currently call elephants.  As for American Indians being a descendent of the Jews (Book of Mormon people), that is also not quite true.  We believe that some of the descendents of the Jews survived the Book of Mormon times, but that may or may not include the American Indians.  It may also include South America as well as various islands.  With all the intermarriage that has happened over the years, finding a \"\"pure\"\" blood line would most likely be difficult.

I might as well anyways.  -   Furthermore, as far as internal textual evidence goes, there are certain things which clearly show that this could not be the work of Ptolemy.  For example, several of the aphorisms make explicit references to Horary astrology, which is not something that Ptolemy addressed at all in the Tetrabiblos.  One of the reasons for this, among others, is that interrogational astrology (ie. horary) was not developed until the 2nd and 3rd centuries and this development occurred in India within the Hindu tradition. (See Pingree, 1996, pg. 21)  Horary was not a part of the mainstream tradition of Hellenistic astrology from which Ptolemy and his contemporaries were drawing on, and it did not become integrated into the western tradition of horoscopic astrology until the Middle Ages when the various Arab and Persian astrologers undertook a synthesis of the Indian, Persian and Hellenistic traditions.  So you see, even the internal evidence in the text itself with the references to horary show that this could not have been the work of Claudius Ptolemy.\n",

Since this is an obvious (and shameless) attempt to use Wikipedia to increase the page ranking of the spammer's website (see Wikipedia:Spam), I've put in a request at m:Non-development tasks for developers#Spam regex requests to have the domain shop263.com added to the project-wide spam filter.

First Ansel Adams, in his three volume 1980 basic photography series, presented the Zone system this way and he explicitly said, in so many words, that his aim is not to force his own system of photography on anyone, but to encourage photographers to better understand their equipment in order to control the finished photograph. He disapproved of winging it, not of any particular system. The Zone system worked for him. And the Zone system is controversial, believe it or not. I know of at least one vocational school photography teacher (years ago when I lived in Montreal) who told students not to bother with it, and it seems he was not alone. \n",

I sure hope that NeilN would take another approach and not jump the gun as he certainly did this time. Also, yes, I am frustrated, and I most certainly have the best reason in the world for that. Mario Roering is not only lying, violating my copyright, slandering, posting defamation etc. here on Wikipedia harming Genseiryu and myself etc. but he does so with dedicated pages in my name on his own homepage and other sites on the Internet. Keeping up with Mario Roering and posting complaints and requests for removal of content on sites such as YouTube, free webhosting etc. is a full time job. Mario Roering has absolutely no just cause for doing what he does, and his involvement here at Wikipedia is no different from his exploiting every other possible way on the Internet to slander me. On the contrary. That is why I do not need anymore crap from anyone, and perhaps I do tend to sort people a little too fast, even though their actions may not have been ill intended, but perhaps the last situation illustrates quite well exactly why I tend to do that? Another good example is when both Mario Roering and I were blocked a few weeks back, Mario Roering was unblocked just an instant later, but I was not, even though we posted the exact same reasons for requesting the unblock. Ever since 2005, when all this started, Mario Roering's candy-talking, deceits and lies have won him favors here on Wikipedia from the admins and others. The last action from NeilN would in my best opinion constitute yet another one such favor. I have never ever postulated, that these favors were done or initiated on purpose, but I have, and I still do claim, that lack of interest for fairness, facts and true intentions, makes this kind of manipulation by Mario Roering possible. And it should not be possible. EVERYONE should be equal to rules and regulations, but for Mario Roering, on mcuh more than one occasion, that has indeed not been the case. Mario Roering has been able to continue his deceitful and ill intended ways on Wikipedia for almost 5 years now. When will it ever stop? As long as it is this easy for Mario Roering to manipulate everyone he wants to, I cannot see the end of it. Even though I still believe that Mario Roering was using NeilN, and that NeilN did indeed jump the gun here siding with one party, instead of issuing equal consequences for both, I will let this one go and \"\"reset\"\" the system. But what I have written here, should be taken into account and something serious should be done about Mario Roering's methods and ways.   \"\n",

As far as I know, there is no official documentation or credible source that states that the calls are a reference to the newpaper and the newspaper ALONE.  So who's to say the calls weren't also chosen because it was an abbreviation of the state's name?  There's plenty of examples of a station using calls with multiple meanings (such as WBBM-TV out of Chicago).  But my main sticking point is that WISN has referenced the calls while advertising itself as \"\"WISconsiN TV\"\" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JFirQUXfc8)  My theory is that the station chose to keep the calls after the newspaper folded because they referenced the state's name as well (the station had only been using the calls for a few years when the paper folded, so the \"\"name recognition\"\" argument is moot).  But regardless of why they kept the calls, I think the fact that the station made a conscious decision to use them to brand itself as \"\"Wisconsin TV\"\" deserves mention.  \"\n",

He was dressed in a black-and-white hooped shirt and pants, a red cape, a wide-brimmed hat, and red gloves. His primary object of theft was hamburgers, hence his name. The character, like Grimace, started out as a villain, only he was old, had a long nose, gray hair, and was called the Lone Jogger in some 1970s commercials, sporting a shirt that said \"\"Lone Jogger\"\". Hamburglar spoke in gibberish which was often translated by Captain Crook.\n",

      "He was revised in 1985, when his look changed from a trollish old man to a red-head Dennis the Menace-type child who spoke and wore a shorter-brimmed hat and a black cape with yellow on the inside. His previously-unintelligible muttering was now the familiar \"\"robble robble.\"\" In \"\"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald,\"\" he took on a new, sporty appearance wearing green goggles, a leather jacket, striped shirt, shorts and sneakers. He loved playing tricks on his friends and still loved burgers. The last appearances of Hamburglar on television were prime time commercials promoting the dollar menu. Hamburglar was voiced by Howard Morris in most commercials, Charlie Adler in some 1980s commercials and \"\"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald\"\"; and Carl W. Wolfe in some 1990s commercials.\n",

He still has a mask, but his face now also sports a good half-inch of designer stubble. The character will be in commercials for the first time since 2002.   \"\n",

For no other pursuit is appropriate to all times, all ages, all situations; but this study nurtures our youth, delights our old age, brightens the good times, and provides a refuge and comfort in bad times; literature brings us pleasure at home, does not hamper us at work, and is the companion of our nights, our travels, our country retreats.\"\": Cicero, Pro Archia Archia Poeta 7.16):\n",

      "In the Middle Ages, law students studied rhetoric, or the art of persuasion, as an essential technique of their profession. In the Renaissance, however, beginning with Petrarch (c. 1310-1380) there was a movement to focus on the philosophical purpose of persuasion, which was to lead men to wisdom (virtue). The humanists looked to Cicero and other Latin authors as their guides, both stylistic and philosophical. Teachers of rhetoric, called dictatores, began also to write treatises on government. They also called into question more traditional Medieval educational programs, which had become a very theoretical and technical study devoted to the fine points of Aristotelean logic and syllogisms, and which featured incorrect and sloppy Latin.\n",

      "The subjects of the studia humanitatis of classical tradition are: Poetry (see above); Rhetoric (developing a polished style), History (which teaches prudence, one of the most important political virtues), and ancient Moral and Political Philosophy. See Quentin Skinner, Visions of Politics, Vol. III: Renaissance Virtues (Cambridge University Press, [2002] 2007), p. 2.  The virtues essential for the citizens and leaders of a well ordered commonwealth comprise: Prudence, Fortitude (courage), Temperance, and Justice (to which Magnanimity, a Stoic, or Senecan virtue, was sometimes added). See Skinner, p. 96. The Heavenly virtues of Faith, Hope, and Charity were above, but did not supersede these. Rather they completed them. In the Renaissance it was thought that virtue rather than birth constituted true nobility.\n",

      "Humanistic study of ancient texts used comparative analysis, and achieved great things. Comparing the style of one textual copy to another of the same work, for example, they could detect inconsistencies and error. Comparing texts of different authors, they learned to identify different styles and periods. The continued use of this form of analysis eventually (very slowly) led to a new way of viewing history as embodying to continuous change and development, of  languages, works of art and literature, as well as of institution. This kind of thinking gradually undermined the former view of humanity and its works as uniform and unchanging. It is not the same as experimental science, but it is a kind of thinking essential to any kind of rational knowledge.173.56.164.199  \"\n",

      "Hello folks, I'm not a wiki-writer.  I just use it from time to time.  But I am familiar with problems when some pages have points of view and agendas written in to them, and the American Civil War articles are rife with these problems.  You'd think the war was still on.  This article on the 43rd Battalion is generally very good, but someone has done their best to wreck the ship, nevertheless.  A paragraph in this article goes off-track and attempts to paint a picture that these soldiers were \"\"guerillas\"\".  Anyone familiar with the writings of the war knows this word was used extensively and daily in newspapers, official US Army reports and accounts to refer to not just uniformed soldiers of the CS Army, but to any and all people of the South.  To discuss the use of this term in this article is a coy trick to insert an agenda, intended to disparage, vice simply communicate good Wiki information about this topic.  \"\"Guerilla\"\" was so commonly used as a term in this war, that it cannot be said, at all, that this term applied to, or was used more commonly for any one unit or group in the war, than any other.  If editors continue to keep this slant and bias in the article, and contiue deleting other fair contributions which are neutral, then my comment here serves as a marker to future editors of the proof of the problem in this page, and the particular set of self-chosen watch-guards who intend to keep it here, while pretending they are not the root cause of the problem.\"\n",

      "Remove – Entire article is of questionable notability. There also appears to be an agenda here, being pushed, often through tag-team and uncivil retorts, on this talk page. Wiki seems to turn more into 4chan and less from an encyclopedia through the manipulation of \"\"not censored\"\" rhetoric, each day. I'm waiting for a photo of a \"\"sheep shagger\"\" to appear on Welsh or Scottish article, under the guise of \"\"notability\"\". Some editors here have serious pro-gay COI/POV issues and need to step back, especially given that this is supposedly a heterosexual activity also and straight people are being accused of \"\"homophobia\"\" out of turn. Why is the solo female fister a cartoon, and the male fister a photo, for a start? Not very neutral. Why does there even need to be a photo, when all the article needs is a description – I mean, it's hardly rocket science, and that guy hardly has a \"\"rocket\"\" worth shouting about? You don't need a photo on how to boil eggs, so why one here? Again, it's anti-Wiki content that brings the entire project into disrepute with regards to making it less accessible to kids, more agenda/politically motivated, more pornographic, less educational, detrimental to every other article/contributor who wants to see Wiki develop. Sadly, it is forced issues like this that lead to conflicts regarding discrimination. Gays complaining about homophobia if the photo is removed are hypocrites, when they themselves use \"\"not censored\"\" as an excuse to discriminate against younger readers. Age discrimination is no less prevalent than sexuality discrimination. Photos such as this are what lead to the Foundation considering an \"\"image filter\"\" recently. I'm pro-LGB (-T) but I also believe in \"\"behind closed doors\"\". And I disagree with anyone who says kids won't look it up. When I was young kids looked \"\"dirty words\"\" up in the dictionary. Now the internet is here, and images like this only serve to corrupt young minds. Let's put it this way: because of \"\"no legal threats\"\", no LGBT members stand a chance of forcing a legal discrimination matter out of this. COPPA stands a better chance, as child protection is of far greater importance than censorship, where there is limited parental control. WikiKamaSutra anyone?  [Chat • RFF] \"\n",

Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.\n",

      "When all hope was gone they [i.e. Qurayza] sought to surrender on the same terms as had the Naḍīr. This time the Prophet intended to make an example of them. He still could not act with complete disregard of public opinion. The degree of the Qurayẓa's treason was by no means clear. Muhammad had previously spared the Banū Qaynuqā c at the request of their former allies the Khazraj. Many Awsites were now pleading that their former confederates be shown mercy. Always the master politician, Muhammad stepped aside and appointed Sa`d b. Mu`ādh to pass judgment upon them. Sa`d was a devout Muslim and a chieftain of the Aws, who was dying of wounds received during the siege against the Qurayza. Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery. Muhammad then declared that this was none other than Allah's decision. Actually, it is clear from the Muslim sources that the Qurayza's fate had been decided even before their surrender. One of Muhammad's emissaries, Abū Lubāba, who had advised the Qurayẓa to give up, had to perform penance for hinting to the Jews what their real fate would be.\n",

      "Stillman doesn't state or imply that Muhammad deferred judgement to Sa'd in order to avoid accusations of double standards (especially when he openly endorsed the decision), so i believe this is original research. what seems more apparent is that, because of the Awsites protesting, it was Sa'd (Aws chieftain) who was chosen to pronounce the judgement, as they may have been more accepting of the decree if it came from their tribal leader.again, with the second sentence in the article, i do not see how the solitary sentence discussing Abu Lubaba substantiates what has been written, or where Stillman is making any \"\"infer[ences]\"\" that Banu Qurayza's fate had already been decided by Muhammad before their surrender.  \n",

Jehochman, whom I have some history with, floated the idea of a siteban. Durova, who has been on my case steady for months on behalf of Cirt, generally bad-mouths me about abusive sockpuppetry, etc but does not ask for a siteban and a few admins float some ideas and come up with this account restriction idea by Ryulong. I agree to it. Then Ryulong backs away from his idea and from the whole thing. Blueboy, a new admin that improperly blocked me, an established editor, as his very first admin action three weeks ago and whom I blew up at and insulted decides to siteban me. He is supported by, guess who, Jehochman, Durova, and Athaenara, whom I also have history with and whose WP:RFA I made a bit difficult and embarrassing by bringing up her past actions with me. I can provide diffs for all of this but I want to show you one thread now, over at Wikinews. Durova comes over there to badmouth and lie about me and a neutral admin, luckily, takes the time to look at the diffs and see who is really harassing whom, here. I invite a neutral admin to do the same here. I have to run now. Please let me know how you would like to proceed. Thanks.\n",

Sorry, as a non-expert, non-German speaker (like most English-speaking Wiki readers), these two powerful ships - as equipped - were less than battleships (for whatever reason), and were not intended to be used as such by the Kriegsmarine. They were, I suggest, intended to see off cruiser escorts and destroy convoys. To me, to call them \"\"battleships\"\" is confusing - they were not the equal of the \"\"Bismarcks\"\" nor even of the \"\"KG5s\"\".

Perhaps English/ German understandings of the term have diverged, and it's a language issue.

Reflecting in the lead every up and down in Putin's ratings is a heavy WP:RECENTISM and WP:Undue weight. Also, as was already said in the discussions above, there are different explanations to the booing story - reflecting them all means putting too much weight to this trivial event, while not reflecting them means non-neutral coverage. At the same event Putin was applauded, and it is not clear who was the person the booing was directed at. It's a sign of bias and yellow press style, and it's quite a pity that BBC and likes put so much attention to this episode. Note that Putin's popularity started decline before that event, and while I don't know the latest opinion polls, it is clear that if the popularity goes up that would be against the theory that that episode was somehow significant, while if the popularity goes down, that would be likely connected to the elections story rather than to some trivial episodes.

It is a rare book that you can read over and over and still find new things. About 5 years ago I read the book and about half way down the first page I realized that in the universe that Harper Lee created in this book, the actual story is very simple and innocent - Scout is just explaining how Jem broke his arm. I have always plumbed the depths of this book, talked about the profundity, it's allusion, the allegory. But this reread I reckon I saw things through Scouts eyes and just listend to what she was saying. To paraphrase - When my brother Jem was 13 he broke his arm badly at the elbow - Then she tells the events that lead up to this happening.

Good.  I would add that images should be shrunk or (better yet) merged, as at [:File:Eriamercol.jpg], so that this can happen.  However, I see File:Traditional_Eritrean_dance.jpg has replaced Tigrinya Eritrean wedding picture File:Eritrea_Eritrean_wedding.jpg.  Is this a problem?

(My opinion would be swayed if it had a written fact-checking policy.)  However, given 3 other sources Vetrisimino0 says confirm Faytinga's mother's ethnicity, it seems reasonable to belive it's true.  Can you accept that, Middayexpress?  If not, I still think her picture merits inclusion (without noting her mother's ethnicity) and 'clutter' is a poor argument for its removal here.\n",

The bulldozer continued moving forward, covering Corrie with dirt and then crushing her.\"\"\n",

      "BBC: 6/27/03  \"\"... Rachel Corrie died in March during a protest against the demolition of a house in the southern Gaza Strip. She suffered multiple injuries when an Israeli Army bulldozer ran over her and later died in hospital.  However, the army said that military police investigating the incident found that Corrie was killed by earth and building rubble falling on her as she tried to climb on a pile of earth while the bulldozer was operating.\"\"\n",

I laugh in the face of those who call themselves unbiased, and your 'wiki' pompousness. Grow some self awareness. Or at least, a bearable level of cynicism. Christian1985's attitude to the Mail is far, far from unbiased. I've read his additions, deletions, comments carefully. In addition, the fact that numerous calls for a controversy area have been silenced is far from unbiased. The fact is, without a controversy section, an article about a controversial paper is not complete. Christian1985's lack of acceptance that a controversy section may be necessary suggests a frightening bias and narrow-mindedness that distinguishes his contribution to the page and, dear Collect, goes AGAINST the very ethos of wiki that you suggest. 81.104.38.217\n",

What is \"\"famous\"\" to you is not \"\"famous\"\" to me, and vice versa.  So either we liberally add the word throughout every article, to describe anything that could be considered by anyone to be \"\"famous\"\", or we don't use it at all, unless it was used in a quote or other trivial exceptions.

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. Some of the worst falsifiers on Wikipedia are Stormie, Lupo, and Matt Crypto. They were challenged to respond to the facts that they suppressed or to concede, and they each conceded that the facts that they suppress are correct and that they delete those facts because they do not want Wikipedia readers to know the truth. They constantly spam their own point of view in their diatribes in which they try to cover up for Nazism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?\n",

      "Many regular writers on Wikipedia are intellectually dishonest  and they regurgitate the top media cover-ups.  They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the \"\"Nationalism\"\" movement, the \"\"Nationalist\"\" magazine, the \"\"Nationalist Educational Association,\"\" their dogma of \"\"military socialism,\"\" and Edward inspired the \"\"Nationalist Party.\"\"  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (\"\"Hakenkreuz\"\" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent \"\"S\"\" letters for their \"\"socialism.\"\"  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized \"\"S\"\" letter for \"\"socialist.\"\" Wikipedia's fibbers cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's dissemblers cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand \"\"Nazi.\"\"  Many Wikipedia posters are propagandists in that there was no \"\"Nazi Party\"\" because it was actually the \"\"National Socialist German Workers' Party\"\" and the party members did not call themselves \"\"Nazis\"\" nor the \"\"Nazi Party.\"\"  The term \"\"Nazi\"\" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the \"\"National Socialist German Workers' Party.\"\"  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a \"\"Nazi\"\" too, in that the term means \"\"National Socialist.\"\"  The term \"\"Nazi\"\" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.  \n",

      "   Hi.  I'm not familiar with Doyle or the topic in general, but perhaps I can give you a sense of whether there should/shouldn't be an article on Doyle. With biographies of living people, there are two hurdles on this Wiki, and they largely overlapverifiability and notability. In both cases, usually the question boils down to this:  are there enough reliable, secondary sources that tell us about the subject that we can read them all, and from those sources alone write a reasonably neutral and factual article? In general such sources are going to be things like newspaper articles, magazine articles and books from reliable publishers, anything with a real editorial staff. No press releases, no use of the fellow's own web site, Facebook page, videos, etc.  For athletes like this it's also possible to fill in additional information from reliable databases of results, but notability really requires articles that discuss the subject in some level of detail. Take a look at [{WP:GNG]], and see if that helps you decide.  looks to be at least one such source,  is a reliable reference but only mentions Doyle in passing. Of the 5 sources listed on streetstunts, 4 are don't meet these requirements, and the fifth might or might notI can't tell since the page is dead.  Looks from what I can tell \"\"borderline\"\" with respect to our policies, but since you know the subject in more detail than I do (or at least I assume so) you probably know of specific resources I'm unaware of that might help flesh out the article.

      "Yeah, so the problem as I see it, is that we still don't have a good number for how many Germans died in Poland except that maybe (according to http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=260621074909720), the max is 1 million (a number that is a little too \"\"round\"\" for my liking).\n",
      "\n",
      "Richard, you reading very carelessly. This is 1.1 in total not round million. Or do you ridicule the estimations at start? The \"\"a million\"\" is because more easy was to estimate the total and the 1946-1950 loses from obvious reasons. Nobody can know exact number of deaths during flight, there was complete chaos. Who died was just buried on spot at road. Some graves disappeared just because were provisionally marked only. I remember some graves of even Polish soldiers on an edge of forest which disappeared in time. The wooden crosses just disintegrated. You do not believe because you are too young.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any event, if you look at the numbers provided in Demographic estimates of the German exodus from Eastern Europe, you see 1,225,000 deaths in the \"\"Eastern German territories\"\" and 263,000 in Poland for a total of 1,488,000 deaths which differs from Nitschke's estimates by about 500,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 500.000 is big number, too big. I would believe in accuracy if the difference would be 100.000. But Nitschke could not count the East lost Polish teritories Kresy . Any way my goal is to separate the Flight number from Expulsion number.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you take this downward revision of 500,000 and add it to the downward revision of 150,000 or so that the joint commission of Czech and German historians proposed, you can see how the ZgV's numbers of 2 million could be revised downards to 1 - 1.2 million which is what I believe Overmans is proposing. I don't understand the 500,000 figure yet.\n",
      "\n",
      " This counting I do not understand. You want see the most exact total number of deaths I suppose. What I attempt is to prevent such quacking like “Poland,…murdered millions of Germans.”. We have to assume that same individuals can be handicapped and can not read and write correctly and the info should be VERY simple.\n",

You need to be professional yourself. Regularly scientific authors do not attack openly the opponent in scientific journals. They rather systematically attack opponent theories in extend period of time. In historical journals can be the same. Maybe you understand in this context that the academic opinion is not easy to grasp. Beside, quite often you need to know the scientists personal animosities. Some Wiki editor can be smarter then me and get multi pro and contra from popular press article on internet. Personally I do not trust popular newspapers there is too many errors and politic manipulations. I would consider “Google” type search in this point as waist of time. \"\n",

These speculations were linked to an earlier event in August 2008, when another pilot of the 36th Special Aviation Regiment was pressured by president Kaczyński to land in Tbilisi during the South Ossetian war between Georgia and Russia. During that incident, Pietruczuk was asked by the president's staff to change the flight plan and land in Tbilisi. After consulting with the commander of his unit, Pietruczuk refused, justifying his decision by safety concerns. He was then visited in the cockpit by Kaczyński himself, who tried to convince him to change his mind. Kaczyński later told journalists: \"\"If someone decides to become an officer, they should not be cowardly\"\". Nevertheless, Pietruczuk held his ground and the plane landed in Azerbaijan as planned. A few weeks after this incident Pietruczuk was decorated by the defense minister for following correct procedures in this case and keeping the safety of his passengers utmost in his mind.

      "The three-revert rule states:\n",
      "An editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page—whether involving the same or different material—within a 24-hour period. An edit or a series of consecutive edits that undoes other editors' actions—whether in whole or in part—counts as a revert. Violations of the rule normally attract BLOCKS of at least 24 hours. Any appearance of gaming the system by reverting a fourth time just outside the 24-hour slot is likely to be treated as an edit-warring violation. See below for exemptions.\n",
      "A \"\"page\"\" means any page on Wikipedia, including talk and project space. A \"\"revert\"\" means any edit (or administrative action) that reverses the actions of other editors, in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material. A series of consecutive saved revert edits by one user with no intervening edits by another user counts as one revert.\n",
      "The three-revert rule applies per person, not per account; reverts made by multiple accounts operated by one editor count together. Editors violating 3RR will usually be BLOCKED for 24 hours for a first incident. Even without a 3RR violation, an administrator may still act if they believe a user's behavior constitutes edit warring, and any user may report edit warring with or without 3RR being breached. The rule is not an entitlement to revert a page a specific number of times.\n",
      "If an editor violates 3RR by mistake, they should reverse their own most recent reversion. Administrators may take this into account and decide not to BLOCK in such cases—for example if the user is not a habitual edit warrior and is genuinely trying to rectify their own mistake.\"\"\n",

Just to add to this, the most recent ofstead report strongly emphasises the need for student and teacher relationships to improve. however, because of the senior staff all living in the 1930's, they took this to mean they need to enforce the rules more, with stronger emphasis on uniform and weaker emphasis on educational support; this has simply degraded student's relationships with their teachers (especially the so - called \"\"senior staff\"\" who don't even teach but instead spend their time punishing people for petty things - the school even employs a certain member of staff whose job it is to be horrible - ironically she is actually called Mrs Horride!) even further.\n",

One particularly inelegant response to somebody who did not agree with him was \"\"Hah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Eh hm. Huh, hah, ha, ha, ha! (Hah!)\"\".

      "Agreed. I amended the article after the chessbase article came out. I think it's only fair to report it, without endorsing or refuting the possibility that Topalov did, in fact, cheat. Dionyseus has never understood the difference between saying, \"\"Topalov was accused of cheating\"\" and \"\"Topalov cheated\"\", so it is possible that he will now delete my edit, arguing that Topalov didn't cheat. It's frustrating and time consuming, arguing with characters like that. And while I had plenty of passive support last year, I'd appreciate some more active support for inclusion this time around, should Dionyseus choose to make another big stink. Apparently, Dionyseus interprets neutrality as the censorship of negative information, no matter how factual. Of course, this is the same guy who, last year, edited Kramnik's article so that it started with a list of his match losses. Of course, I wouldn't want to infringe upon wiki's tradition of love, charity, and respect; so, I feel I should clarify my position insofar as I absolutely DO NOT regard Dionyseus to be 1) a blight on wikipedia, 2) a mental degenerate, 3) incapable of lucid reasoning, or 4) incapable of language use. He is certainly none of those things. And admins may take that as an official statement.  \"\n",

How does a government decide how many credits ought to be issued (for free, I assume) to each entity before trading begins?  Indeed, most questions about emissions trading boil down to this very question.  For example, if an auction is used, and the auction is efficient, economics would predict that no trades would take place post-auction (the occurrence of such trades would imply that the auction had been improper)  making the whole concept of \"\"cap and trade\"\" actually mean \"\"cap via auction\"\".  I don't mean any of this as criticism.  But, as Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, I think it's failing to fulfill it's job here by dodging the most policy-critical aspect of the issue.

      "\n",
      "Internet types love sweeping ideas that come in the form of book titles that morph into catchphrases that can be dropped like little bombs into conversations to show how smart they are. \n",
      "\"\"Well, you know, his company was vulnerable to The Innovator's Dilemma, especially because he didn't have a World Is Flat strategy, although he could've seen it coming if he'd tapped into a Wisdom of Crowds approach.\"\" \n",
      "\n",
      "This is at its most grating when said with a Thurston Howell III accent.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, the concept of \"\"the wisdom of crowds\"\" — the title of a popular 2004 book by James Surowiecki — is particularly hot among tech companies right now. Yet in the past week, the concept has run into a couple of potholes. One is a rhubarb at Internet darling Digg.com; the other, the U.K. government's case of the hijacked wiki. \n",
      "\n",
      "Both have people wondering if crowds are really all that wise, and what conditions have to exist to make them wise. Why is it that some crowds seem smart, while others turn into ugly mobs? \n",
      "\n",
      "At its most basic level, the wisdom of crowds — let's call it WOC, so I don't have to type as much — means that the aggregated thought and knowledge of thousands or millions of people can be smarter than trained individual experts. \n",
      "\n",
      "The WOC has been around forever — it's what democratic elections try to tap into. But the Net takes it to a whole new level. \"\"The Internet provides a mechanism to get lots of diverse opinions and aggregate it in a quick and cost-effective way,\"\" Surowiecki tells me. \n",
      "\n",
      "So if a company can use the Net to tap the collected intelligence of its employees, the employees will make better decisions than the CEO. IBM, Google and others have tried this. Wikipedia, written and edited by tens of thousands of unpaid contributors, should be better than an encyclopedia written and edited by specialists. News sites such as Digg, which lets users vote stories to the front page, should surface the best stuff more effectively than professional editors. \n",
      "\n",
      "Except it doesn't always work that way. Pointing specifically at Wikipedia, Lauren Weinstein of the People for Internet Responsibility says that the Net has propagated a \"\"basic fallacy that a wisdom-of-crowds approach could ever work, even theoretically.\"\"   \n",
      "\n",
      "Which might be extreme. But clearly some of the WOC mechanisms in use today have shortcomings. \n",
      "\n",
      "Take Digg. Founder Kevin Rose set it up with a simple premise: If you like a news item or blog post, you can \"\"digg\"\" it by voting for it. Items with the most votes move to the front of the home page. But cabals of users started working together to boost certain items. Digg became less about the WOC and more about the ambitions of 1,000 or so savvy members. \n",
      "\n",
      "So last week, Rose changed the formula. Digg will use computer programs to try to devalue bloc voting and give more value to what appears to be independent thinking. Digg's regulars revolted, causing a big Web stink. But Surowiecki thinks the site will now be better. \n",

      "So WOC needs the right structure to work, something the U.K.'s Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) found out the hard way. \n",
      "\n",
      "DEFRA decided to let the public help it write environmental contracts, so it posted one on the Net as a wiki. The idea of a wiki — such as Wikipedia — is that anyone can log on and add or change something. In the case of DEFRA's wiki, the public mutilated it. In one of the more printable alterations, someone changed \"\"Who are the parties to the environmental contract\"\" to \"\"Where is the party for the environmental contract? Can I come? Will there be cake? Hooray!\"\" \n",

This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. \n",

      "If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or \"\"db\"\" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.     \"\n",

But Wikipedia doesn't really care about respecting minority view articles in many cases.

I think it is a failure due to mismanagement or due to premeditation.   But I believe it is a failure.  I know it is not blasphemy to say Wikipedia fails in issues like this.

Also its true that the modern Bulgarians are nothing turkic, as they are white europeans. Aren't Bulgarians white? Then what race are they? Croats are our closest relatives and they are proven by scientists. Also in many Bulgarian historical books it states clearly that the Bulgarians are closely related to the Hungarians and Croats as they were all part of one tribe in Eastern Europe. To include middle eastern as part of the Bulgarian genetic section is horrendous as it has nothing to do with the Bulgarian people. Mediterranean only partly. There are other evidence that states that Bulgaria has a stronger slavic influence like the Croats and the Slovenes, however there are some sources that claim they are separated from the tight slavic cluster together with the southern croats, serbs, macedonians and romanians. Both different sources should be respected but to include a middle eastern section is beyond belief, its a lie and totally ridiculous. Bulgarians are a mixture of slavic, alpine, dinaric, mediterranean, nordic and pontid. Pontids and the north pontids are about 50% of the population and they are a mix of atlanto mediterranean heritage and nordic people.\n",

      "This link Article: \"\"The Unknown Martin Luther King, Jr.\"\" has twice been removed by one particular editor, first with a remark in including the words \"\"What's next? a link to Stormfront?\"\" which I do not understand, and later to dismissing the link as \"\"racist\"\", which like many convenience-words ending in \"\"ist\"\" can be defined to mean whatever the user intends it to mean (often a derogatory and empowering substitute for lack of intellingent reasoned discussion).  I do not think the link is one to be treated as vandalism, which I am sorry must be common in any article about a well-known leader.  The subject matter of the linked article does not seem to be concerned with expression of a particular point of view on race (if this is what \"\"racist\"\" means): if it did it would not be relevant to the MLK page.  But it does seem to be biographical, has some nice photographs, and is well-written and reasonable, and therefore of interest.  As an experienced (non-American, with no point of view on the subject of the article) contributor to wikipedia, I believe a variety of appropriate links to a subject is of interest, and contributes to understanding.  And a variety of independent views expressed of a subject enriches, and is the way to approach the truth, like any scientific research: it is not for editors to filter links because they contain matter showing the subject to be less than perfect - we are all human - and I can understand that this might be the reason.\n",

      "Tizoc is a notable American Composer of New Musichttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_20th_century_classical_composers#1970s.  At a very early age he began studying piano, and in Middle School began taking trumpet lessons at the Los Angeles Music and Arts School. There he also began taking Mariachi lessons and by age 16 was fully immersed into the Mariachi world.  Today Tizoc is privileged to have had the opportunity to play along side of some of the most talented Mariachi musicians in the world and enjoys sharing his passion for Mariachi music through teaching and performing.\n",
      "\n",
      "While completing his undergraduate work at Chapman University, through the support of professors and his wife, Tizoc realized a passion for writing music. Tizoc’s new found excitement for composition and new music led him to participate in Chapman’s New Music and Percussion Ensembles where he began learning percussion, and expanding his exposure to 21st century music. By his second year at Chapman, Tizoc gained admission into the composition program and began studying with composers Sean Heim and Shaun Naidoo. Compositionally, Tizoc is influenced by many different kinds of music, and aspires to use music as a medium to express some of our inner most emotions and states of mind.  His music has been performances by Chapman Universities Chamber Orchestra, New Music Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble as well as The California Ear Unit.\n",

I for sure want to know about potential harm of this drug. I would think as a medical professional that you would be more inspired by the \"\"first do no harm\"\" idea. The fact that you Wikipedia jerks are so focused on having only sources from a narrow range of whatever it takes for a given article is so frustrating. I've continued to run into this kind of thing. You would think that academic journals have taken over Wikipedia. The idea that I have actually improved the article with my additions, and that others can improve it further, has completely escaped much of the Wikipedia culture these days. Wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited, rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides. You guys are disgusting, really. You are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are, namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements. Now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created Wikipedia in the first place. The fact that you have excluded something that is evidence of significant danger to pregnant women based on this culture of exclusiveness should trouble you deeply.   \"\n",

I would not be surprised if some of them are getting well paid for their work.  Their willingness to go to any lengths to ban, harass, or IMO wear-out other contributing editors (who disagree with their view points) and willingness to use whatever tactics they can to promote their Skeptics society Point-of-View of credible scientists like Deepak or Rupert Sheldrake, or Frederic Myers, or Ian Stevenson or even William James, all of which the biographies here on Wikipedia have been modified in a very POV slanted manner (by many of these same small group of editors, sometimes in a very insidious labeling manner, such as calling Deepak Chopra a new-age Guru, or mentioning early on that Ian Stevenson was a \"\"gullible individual\"\" etc.  I really do wonder how Wikipedia can continue to maintain there is any kind of veridical neutrality being practiced here?\n",

Professor Wessely is a psychiatrist, and for nearly twenty years he has promulgated the idea that ME and the broader groupings of chronic fatigue illnesses (CFS) are the product of ‘false illness beliefs’, mental aberrations, which can be diagnosed and treated with psychiatric based therapies and anti-depressants. \n",

He is a member of numerous research organisations and advisory groups, and is advisor to the British Armed Services. While his membership of an ‘official’ web of research organisations tell us a lot about his work, added substance to his views is to be found in his more informal and less renowned associations with a number of minority-view groups set up by, or aligned with US and British ‘quackbuster’ organisations. \n",

He made clear even at this early stage of the exchange that Wikipedia would from then on act on the basis that ‘anything from your site (will be treated) with extreme scepticism.’ Jimbo Wales, ended his e-mail with an exhortation for everyone to settle differences and unit in the spirit of Wikichristmas. \n",

Comparing the pictures of Kelly and Belle, they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it - Belle's eyes are little lighter. Someone made a video called \"\"Behind Belle's Hazel Eyes\"\", the person who made this video knew what color Belle's eyes were and decided to include Belle's name in the title. And if you read the comments, the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like \"\"green or hazel? they look more hazel than brown or green . yup belles﻿ eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved\"\". I like the \"\"problem solved\"\" part. With Minotaurgirl's bias against the idea of Belle having hazel eyes, I think there will always be a problem with people like her involved.\n",

      "TV Tropes has already suffered an edit war because of her, so much so they forbade users from writting what Belle's eye color is. Notice how Belle's name is missing from the Eye Color tropes colony, while the rest of Disney Princesses have their eye color mentioned. Belle's name was there under the category of Hazel Eyes until Minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all. Same thing almost happened to Disney Wiki. This is Minotaurgirl's account, as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite, the reason; inserting false information, the false information being writting down Belle's eyes as brown.] And now here's Minotaurgirl on the Wikipedia. Is there any repsite from her?\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed she has a Live Journal account. See what she has written. The lack of links speaks for itself. She thinks she actually proved Belle's eyes are brown, depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie, like the screenshots she send me. By magnifying the images, you can see her eyes are hazel-colored and not the same color as her hair at all. Notice how she's afriad to use close-ups of Belle's eye cuz she knows they'll appear hazel if she did so, thus disproving her. On her blog, she didn't mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki, and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belle's eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel, when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didn't. She wrote \"\"Bleh. Kids these days. This one needs a hobby. I'm tired of wasting time trying to undo this snot's damage, and I'm fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. Would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners?\"\" Yup, she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobby-less kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl said/believes.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anyone deserves to be blocked, it's Minotaurgirl. If it wasn't for her bias, sites like like TV Tropes, Disney Wiki and the Wikipedia wouldn't have suffered an edit war about Belle's eye color. The fact that there was never an edit about Belle's eye color until Minotaurgirl came along, says a lot. Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago, no edit war about Belle's eye color happened there either. It's like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belle's eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown, just cuz she likes to think so, not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. It's like someone going around changing Ariel's eyes from blue to green, just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being green-eyed. Thinks don't work like that.\n",

Just because some one writes books and they are used as sources in articles is not a good way to determine primary use.  I'd argue that the 59 references used to write the Mary Miller (actress) implies a much more notable person and better makes the case then another article that is based on only a single reference.  I think that adding Mary Millar in the list of statistics confuses many since it is just a similar spelling and that would be better handled as a See also on the dab page.  Obviously this means that the current page needs to be disambiguated to Mary Miller (art historian) to allow the dab page to be moved.  Using the statistics provided in opposition to this proposal clearly shows that, if anything, the current article does not even receive a majority of the hits.

This was a group of friends who had worked together on peotry, prose and cultural conscience from the mid-forties until the term became popular natuionally in the late fifties. The group consisting of Kerouac ... Neal Cassady, William Burroughs ... Herbert Huncke, John Clellon Homes ...

LeRoi Jones  all of whom accepted the term at one time or another, humorously or seriously, but sympathetically, and were included in a survey of bet general manners, morals, and literature by Life magazine in a lead article in the late '50s by one Paul O'Neill, and by the journalist Alfred Aronowitz in a large series on the Beat Generation in the New York Post.\n",

The basic reasoning is, that it is impossible for avid editors to read pages without editing them, so if you've read the policies and guidelines, that would show up in your contributions.  On guidelines you can generally make minor changes directly to the guidelines themselves.  With policies, unless it is fixing grammar or typos, you pretty much need to post the edits you want to make to the talk page for approval - but that becomes habit after you get used to it.  So my advice is that you start proofreading the P&G;'s, and see where that takes you.  I see David Fuchs has prepared a nomination for you.

Many cross-referencing using various reliable sources of data and audits exists for those people. As mentioned earlier, Forbes.com's blog post on Agostinelli isn't sourced with any data whatsoever; therefore, no one is in any position to decipher where they obtained their information. The financial journal (OGFJ) cites the $1 billion fund value in what would appear to be as reliable as one can get given the disclosure came in the context of a major financial transaction which would have implied due diligence. The Forbes.com blog source must therefore be treated accordingly and not taken as gospel or absolute. For all we know, it could be a well-orchestrated public relations bamboozling. It certainly wouldn't be the first time.

What a shame that Jews, who found solace in the Turkish Ottoman Empire, while the rest of Europe was have progrom festivals have come on board, too.

You can find such comparisons in almost all economy section of country articles, such as that one in Portugal. In other words, some comparisons are appropriate and should not be completely removed. As I say, you reverted all of my edits, so I did agree with some of your edits, which I left out or reworded in an appropriate manner. I do agree with the picky statistics, and removed comparisons in industrial outputs. For all comparisons made, I included reason why it is made, so it is made clear that it is not a POV. Some of your claims are vague, such as \"\"due to its healthy manufacturing base\"\", which clearly points to original research. You have also removed the IMF forecasts without a valid reason, which is clearly appropriate to show where S Korea is heading right now and useful in demonstrating the speed at which it is growing. I do agree to the technology section and removed some comparisons. My point is that you can't remove all the statistics just because you/or some Wikipedia readers think it is making comparisons - achievements should be recognized and the best way to do so is through comparison.

Don't worry, you didn't sounds condescending, and I respect the inclusion of a 3rd party (btw: do you mind if I ask who it is?). Anyway, I believe it very superfulous to have a heading labeled plot + a spoiler tag. It seems very redundant, as most people who read that it's the plot, will take it to mean that it contains the whole plot, details, endings and all. As for Joe Schmoe talking in the coffe shop with x and y in town z being what the show is about, that information belongs in a plot introduction, which generally comes before the plot, without any heading.

The article needs to be rewritten or expanded such that it accurately graps ALL of the Charter, with references not only to its policies towards Israel, but its social and economic policies and ambitions as well. Since the majority of Hamas' efforts are directed to domestic efforts and not terrorist activities, those aspects of its charter should not be shoved aside.

      "Thank you for your kind reply. Judging from the sources I have, I think the concept of spatial tense is only relevant in the context of the artificial language Lojban. The statement that several natural languages have spatial tense as defined in the article is still an unsubstantiated claim, so imho it should be pulled out pending evidence. Part of the problem is the very name of the concept. 'Tense' has the connotation of 'time'. In fact, grammatical tense is frequently (if loosely) defined as 'location in time'. Thus, it doesn't really make sense to talk about 'spatial tense'; it would be like talking about 'temporal place'.\n",
      "Since the only relevant use of the concept stems from Lojban grammar, I think it would be best to start the article out of the Lojban perspective, defining spatial tense as Lojban grammar defines it. And since spatial tense (according to Lojban grammar) is merely 'obligated expression of location', the broader context of the article should be the expression of space in language. And this is where observations about the connection between language and the way we perceive the world come in. The way I see it, the spatial cases of the Hopi language (one of the many languages that do very interesting things with space) don't really belong in an article about an invented, English-inspired, grammatical category. What we are really missing is a decent article about the way languages deal with location and space. Which is something I added to my to do list. —  (talk) 16:55, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)\n",

      "Look all I am saying is that the term \"\"Iranian\"\" is a very loose term and people can get easily confused when they see this. Iranic would be a better term to use. Nontheless, there is no doubt that the Kurdish language is a bit similar to other languages such as Persian but there is also a difference as well. I am speaking as a Kurd myself. There is evidence that the Kurds have the highest chance out of all the other ethnic groups of being descendants of the Medes, all one has to do is look at lingustics. Although, it is also important to know that the Kurds have been in the middle east for a very very long time, and there have been many other empires/people as well. There have also been, for example, claims that Kurds are also descendants of the Gutians. It all boils down to what you believe, but to say that the Kurds are an Iranian people, is sort of going overboard. \n",

      "Kurds are an ethnic group in the Middle East that inhabit adjacent parts of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syira known as Kurdistan. The Kurds speak a language known as Kurdish, which form a subgroup of the NorthWestern Iranian languages. The Kurds are known to be an Iranic people because of close linguistic and cultural ties with other Iranians. The Kurds are also known to be descendants of the Medes, according to many scholars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somewhere along those lines. Saying that Kurds are an \"\"Iranian ethnic group\"\" is is vague, confusing, and somewhat mis-leading. What I wrote is a bit more clear and I wrote why they are considered an Iranic people with the sentences supporting it. Notice how I also said a language known as Kurdish. I do not know on what insane consensus that people decided it should be \"\"Kurdish language(s).\"\" Kurdish is one language which is mainly based of two dialects, that are spoken by almost all Kurds. Those two dialects are Kurmanji and Sorani, both of which are highly similar. All Kurds regard their language as one. I am a Kurdish Sorani speaker and I can understand a Kurmanji speaker perfectly. Kurds in Turkey, Syria, and Half of Iraq speak Kurmanji. Then the other Half of Iraqi Kurdistan speak Sorani, with Kurds in Iran speaking Kurdish Sorani as well. There are also a few other dialects such as Hawrami which is spoken by about 10% of Kurds. Nonetheless, the Kurdish language is one language with 2 main dialects, both of which are highly similar to each other. \n",

Three years later, in May, 1945, I was a replacement joining this Division where I earned my combat badge in June of that year. June 30th did not see the end of combat for this Division. I was an 18yr. old replacement and a member of Company D, 145th Infantry Regiment when we were sent deep into the Cagahan(Sp?) Valley of Northern Luzon with the assignment to thwart the fleeing soldiers of Japan from reaching the dense forested hills bordering that Valley. Our Company was engaged in many firefights with these retreating Japanese army units. My last combat missions were ended soon after the Dropping of the atomic bombs on the Japanese main land in early August. While my combat experience was very limited, I did come face-to-face with my own mortality during these few months of combat experience.

What I want is you to use your tool to copy the list from the url link given and insert the list into the template but formatted horizontally as you'd expect in a nav plate. If I set up all of the township templates in this way can you copy directly from the url ink which will be provided for each one? I think that would be the best way to do it. Don't worry about creating lists that need dabbing as when I come to dab after they are all started I will see \"\"what link here\"\".  Basically I am creating the townships of Burma templates which are actually the third-level divisions but you needn't worry about that as the lists will be accessed via the urls in the relative templates I make OK?♦ Dr. Blofeld \"\n",

      "P.S. In response to 'canvassing': I think such accusations are, once again, biased. We see users such as Kittybrewster admit to it, but nothing happens, because she is supporting the status quo. Canvassing for the status quo=acceptable. Canvassing for a minority position=unacceptable. This, despite the fact that Wikipedia calls for a pluralistic approach that takes multiple viewpoints into account, unless those views represent an extreme margin. And in this case, Wikipedia may have erred. From BBC to ABC, Cambridge University to UCLA, my work has been accepted by the very highest echelons in academia and the mainstream media. Yet I'm being voted off the island by persons such as MLA, who doesn't know anything about the field and whose main contributions to Wikipedia have bee the creation of MMA articles. And this speaks to the larger ills of society itself, not just Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a tool that reflects society. We still, in the majority, value violence and sports over academic pursuits. Football, soccer, basketball players all make much more than college professors, even the best and brightest in the field. Thus the problem is not just with Wikipedia, but society itself.\n",

      "Finally again, FYO I am more than two, but slightly less than three, standard deviations above the 'average' IQ, and therefore I see fit to say that I, like Michael C Price, and more than two orders of magnitude above the average member of society. Even if the average Wikipedian is slightly above societal average, we can still see the groundwork of 'one' order of magnitude higher. Of course, an established Wikipedian may be well above the average Wikipedia user, so again those comments were not about you personally but about the system, which I see as having quite many flaws. I do hope that these types of 'essays' will lead to 'constructive' improvements in the future.\n",

So, to argue that the fact that other articles use collapsed templates somehow implies Muhammad's article should do it too, is in itself a scorn-worthy fallacy. @Anthonyhcole - no, it's not.

      "is commonly performed by grinding (shaping) the tungsten electrode into a fine, burr-less 'pencil point', using a high speed diamond abrasive wheel. The shape, and angle acuteness of the point, also plays a role in the 'focused' shape of the plasma arc.  The DC arc largely applicable to ferrous metals, benefits from using 2% thoriated tungsten (or 2% ceriated tungsten, an alternative to the radiological concerns of Thorium), while nonferrous metals such as aluminum and magnesium requiring AC current, are performed best with pure tungsten allowing the tip to melt into an enlarged balled surface at the end of the electrode.  A \"\"ball-point\"\" subsequently flares the arc onto a much broader surface of the material, where greater expansion and distortion must then be accommodated, or anticipated as part of the welders job.\n",

Washing, degreasing, rinsing etc, but mechanical abrasion is fast, easy and most popular as shaping a weld chamfer can be done simultaneous to \"\"cleaning\"\".   AlumaPrep (or some brand name like that), is simply an acid rinse to remove stubborn anodizing and any last marks of finger print oil from the 'touchy' AC needing metals.  But as Triddle pointed out in his explanation of +/- wave form capable machines, the plasma itself will often do a fine job of burning off simple surface impurities.  Deep inclusions (ubiquitous in sand casted work) are a frustration all unto themselves.  Welder (the person) tolerance, patience, and experience must often judge what level of weld quality exist after cooling.  High-tech work, demands that the work piece billet is good stuff to begin with, yet there is a variety of filler rod that can be used to accommodate persnickety base material.  Nickle, Bronze and \"\"Everdure\"\" (brand name) are often blended into filler rods, and greatly assist the welder trying to fix cracked engine blocks or other sandy and oil impregnated work pieces.\n",

Low carbon 316 SS (316L) commonly desired for biomedical applications where autoclaving and bleach will still kick the ass out of Stainless Steel.  Titanium and its many grades are like wise a subject for deep thought, but once the decision is made...  it works like soft butter, and few other welds can look so nice raw.\n",

Do some research on skeptic BLPs and notice how much George Monbiot is quoted, and he's not even a scientist!.

Now we have similar opinions from a respected climatologist, published in the Wall Street Journal, and all of a sudden it's a primary source?! Please! Anyone who spends more than 5 minutes examining the histories can see the blatant hypocrisy of your position. In fact, on BLP/N right now there is a debate about Michaels' criticism started by none other than ChrisO  this is the same editor who has, in the last week, edit-warred to include non-notable and weakly-sourced criticism in Chris Monckton's BLP.

      "{{unblock reviewed|1=Sorry for my blurb here, I went in detail elsewhere. If an admins reviews the complete history of astrotheology, they will notice that I've been patient while I had to deal with other editors extreme language at me. That creates a very stressful situation. Please see here for outside opinion. I did not use the same kind of language against Hrafn, and he had no right to immediately jump on my case while I added content to the article. I was the only active contributor to that astrotheology that was adding content to it, even before the AfD process. I noticed it was a stub and started to add content. How am I being disruptive to other there, when there was no other editors that wanted to contribute? I even listed 30 potential sources on the talk page that had mentions of astrotheology. Others could have reviewed them and find if they had anything worthwhile if they actually wanted to be \"\"an editor of astrotheology\"\" and *add content*. Hrafn, on the talk page, even labeled me as an atheist and other categorized pov pusher. It is obvious he was against something, but that something wasn't me like he thought, and he couldn't believe otherwise  or choose not to. Somehow this went from something that was just a little beyond a content dispute because of the harassment I got from Hrafn, to where Durova stepped in and it went directly to ArbCom. She did ask about PastorDavid, but I looked and I left evidence on AN/I of why I didn't accept his offer  that is not a refusal to dispute resolution, that is seeing that the one who offered mentor made a questionable vote on an AfD. I felt another mentor/mediator, would be best. (Personal attack/comment redacted by   ) If you look however, I did ask on the talk page for astrotheology to Hrafn about RS/N over the Physico-Theology book... he didn't answer at all to that question, but he went on to despise me instead with more \"\"egregious misintrepretations.\"\" As for the previous dispute resolution attempts before that Durova noted, those weren't because of disruptive editing. I never caused anybody to leave wikipedia. If you seriously think I did, it would be more appreciate if you mentioned that evidence to support it than just baselessly blame me. The previous mediation was recommended by a mentor, (Comments redacted by   ) I hate the show the mistakes she made also, we aren't all-knowing saints of wikipedia policy from day one. Why did she even bring it old beginnings back up? The computer science related one was dealt with differently since it was called unfair why I got blocked before. After unblock, the consensus continued , and it still sustains today. If I truly was trying to disrupt like Durova claims, don't you think a intentional disrupter would stalk her and revert her edits and such all along. (Comment redacted by   ) It would be a test to see if she requests unblock, but since she made it clear on my talk page she never want to see me again, I really doubted her olive branch. I deleted a section here on my talk page of her \"\"vanish\"\" forever bit. I simply did not reply to her, (Comment redacted by   ) You can argue all you want that I changed the section title, which policy does allow for neutral view, (Comments redacted by   ) When ArbCom said this is obvious, I truly don't think he meant to block me... the obvious answer is let the community help  offer to help mediate. I saw absolutely no other offer to help mediate besides PastorDavid's. However, I sent an e-mail to ask her \"\"why... why.. why..\"\"... but now she is calling it \"\"obscene,\"\" and offers to show it to any admin. If you read it(Comment redacted by   ) Like I said on AN/I...|decline=reason — Not only has the user not apologized for obvious bad behavior, but has offered further attacks and emails with multiple four letter words (the G-D word primarily) to his opponents.

Regardless, I am disgusted that you have spent this much energy trying to censor what you don't like, and almost no energy trying to improve it.  Wikipedia is not about silencing what you don't like.  As for the deletion request, it will be handled in its own way.  It is improper in the extreme to try to anticipate it by cutting links.  You should wait for the deletion request, and you should take seriously the views of a large number of experienced editors.  And as for the rhetorical bit, please leave that aside.  People have lost lives on all sides of thisand everyconflict.  You are demanding that we should all simply bow down and accept your view, and that's just not how it works.  You must workif you wish to work here at allby seeking consensus with other editors, including those you disagree with, including those whom you wish to blame for the \"\"martyrs in your family.\"\"  If you cannot or will not do that, then you should leave the editing to others.  So far, I do wish that you would take 10% of the time you have spend arguing, deleting, and fighting, and spend it actually improving the image and the articles you would like to see improve.  All you are doing now is being disruptive.  If you cannot manage to see that everyone here is working together, and nobody is out to slander or harm you, you will find Wikipedia very difficult.  As for your claim that there is no Orthodox representation, I wonder how you know, except for your entirely groundless claim that every Orthodox Christian would agree with you.    \"\n",

Some duplication is OK but when I have no way to decide what should go into new antisemitism and what should go into antisemitism, I think there's a problem.  The advantage of contemporary antisemitism over new antisemitism is that it has quite a clear definition.  The advantage of new antisemitism over contemporary antisemitism could be that new antisemitism is not just antisemitism in the here and now but somehow something different.  That we have a history of new antisemitism suggests that a difference exists, but I don't see what that difference is.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current introduction says that new antisemitism is \"\"the wave of antisemitism that escalated, particularly in Western Europe, after the Second Intifada in 2000, the failure of the Oslo accords, and the September 11, 2001 attacks.\"\" But it then says what is different about new antisemitism is that old antisemitism \"\"was largely associated with the political right.\"\"  So I'm confused.  Is it the distinguishing factor the timing, or is it more to do with the source, in which case perhaps we should be talking not about new antisemitism but about new antisemites; a new chorus singing an old song?  In the introduction we mention anti-zionism in passing, but we don't make clear what the relationship between it and new antisemitism is, we just say that there is one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The history section talks about a Soviet new anti-Semitism, and says this antisemtism was \"\"close to its modern form\"\".  But it doesn't explain what close means.  Presumably there are important ways in which it is similar and ways in which it is different, but the article doesn't explain what they are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further down, we seem to be equating new antisemitism with anti-zionism.  Maybe this is the crux of my issues with this article.  We have anti-zionism; hatred of/opposition to an jewish state.  We have anti-semitism; hatred of/opposition to the jewish race (common usage. technically arabs are also semites, but lets not go there now).   We can also identify anti-Israel sentiment; opposition to some or all aspects of Israel.  These things all overlap, but it's hard to say that any of them are the same, or a subset of each other.  For example there were jews opposed to the creation of Israel because it was man-made, not created by god.  And some dislike of Israel is anti-semitic, but not all of it.  The boundaries are fuzzy, but for each of these concepts there is a clear and unmistakable core.  I can't say that for new-antisemtism.  I can't identify what new-antisemitism is that old-antisemtism is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, new antisemitism seems to be a grab bag of an expression that mixes some different issues:  1. the apparent resurgence in antisemitism, which I suggest properly belongs at contemporary antisemitism; 2. the difficulty in distinguishing between legitimate/illegitimate criticism of israel, which I suggest belongs here, or possibly at anti-zionism; and 3. the changing nature of the anti-semite (left/right/arab/european/russian/...) which I suggest belongs at contemporary antisemitism and/or at antisemitism.

Its members are taught its precepts by a series of ritual dramas, which folow ancient forms and use stonemasons' customs and tools as allegorical guides.

      "The traditional view of the origins of Freemasonry is that it descended in a direct line from a presumed governing body of operative stonemasons. There is, however, no firm evidence to support this view. In England, no organisation of operative or working masons survived The Reformation, and there are only a few instances of non-working masons being admitted to masonic lodges during the 17th century - probably with the aim of creating meeting places for those who sought to promote religious and political tolerance in an intolerant age. Honorary members were also admitted to operative masonic lodges in Scotland, but there is no evidence that such lodges employed ceremonies of initiation or engaged in philosophical discussion.\n",

      "Truly Speculative Masonry can be certainly dated only to 1717, when four lodges in London united to form a Grand Lodge as a governing body of English Freemasonry.

      "Hi, I noticed you had reverted my changes to the hazel eye section however left me a message informing me I could contact you on your talk page providing more information. I've numerously tried to get Wikipedia to change the hazel eye color section as it's informing people that hazel eyes can be gold/brown and green (either could be dominant) which is a myth as a hazelnut doesn't contain any significant green colouration whatsoever, it is true that sometimes very minimal green tints are present in a brown eye to produce a golden glow and create the hazel colour but hazel eyes can never be eyes that are significantly green with slight brown/gold admixture, that is a North American misconception which is believed to have occurred in the past 100 years or so, as in Europe the origin of light/coloured eyes and hazelnuts, the true/original meaning is still used. The problem is there is no documentation on hazel eye definitions changing throughout the years nor has there ever been a study conducted tracing back to how the myth/misconception in North America came about, it's more of an assumption that people have come to realize as North Americans have started inaccurately identifying eyes that are significantly green with slight brown admixture as well as eyes that are blue or grey with brown admixture; as the colour hazel because they're multi-coloured and appear to change in different lighting even though they don't resemble the colour of a hazelnut in any way. It's an issue/myth that requires common sense to understand really, so even though I cannot provide you with documentation or studies concerning the changes of hazel eye definitions becoming misconceived in North America I can provide you with numerous sources/pictures of what hazel eyes are supposed to be and what the colour 'hazel' is described as being;\n",

I only hope you're more understanding of this issue and can agree with what i'm saying, I strongly think you should keep my last changes to the hazel eye section so people can understand/know about what hazel eyes are supposed to be rather than leaving the information as it is feeding people with the North American myth. That being said the hazel eyes picture on the right of the hazel eye section isn't green or gold in any way it's actually a blue eye with significant brown around the pupil, the hazel eye section doesn't say anything about haz\n",

This explains why I am gone; it also explains why many others, including some extremely knowledgeable and helpful people, have left the project. \n",

      "The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problemor I, at least, regard it as a problemwhich explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist (which would, in this context, mean excluding the unwashed masses), it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very hard.) \n",

Ultimately, it became very clear that the most active and influential members of the projectbeginning with Jimmy Wales, who hired me to start a free encyclopedia project and who now manages Wikipedia and Wikimediawere decidedly anti-elitist in the above-described sense. \n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, nearly everyone with much expertise but little patience will avoid editing Wikipedia, because they willat least if they are editing articles on articles that are subject to any sort of controversybe forced to defend their edits on article discussion pages against attacks by nonexperts. This is not perhaps so bad in itself. But if the expert should have the gall to complain to the community about the problem, he or she will be shouted down (at worst) or politely asked to \"\"work with\"\" persons who have proven themselves to be unreasonable (at best). \n",
      "\n",
      "This lack of respect for expertise explains the first problem, because if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, they would have long since invited a board of academics and researchers to manage a culled version of Wikipedia (one that, I think, would not directly affect the way the main project is run). But because project participants have such a horror of the traditional deference to expertise, this sort of proposal has never been taken very seriously by most Wikipedians leading the project now. And so much the worse for Wikipedia and its reputation. \n",
      "\n",
      "This lack of respect for expertise and authority also explains the second problem, because again if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, there would necessarily be very little patience for those who deliberately disrupt the project. This is perhaps not obvious, so let me explain. To attact and retain the participation of experts, there would have to be little patience for those who do not understand or agree with Wikipedia's mission, or even for those pretentious mediocrities who are not able to work with others constructively and recognize when there are holes in their knowledge (collectively, probably the most disruptive group of all). A less tolerant attitude toward disruption would make the project more polite, welcoming, and indeed open to the vast majority of intelligent, well-meaning people on the Internet.

      "\n",
      "According to Ralph Keyes, the quote in the article \"\"I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong... No Viet Cong ever called me nigger\"\" is a misquotation.  Keyes says: When Muhammad Ali refused induction into the Army, he was widely quoted as saying, “No Viet Cong ever called me nigger.” This was a perfect marriage of anti-war and anti-racist sentiment. Better yet, it came straight from the mouth of a mega-celebrity thought to possess primitive folk wisdom. The only problem is that Ali never made this comment. “It’s wasn’t really his mind-set to say something in that way,” explained Ali biographer Thomas Hauser. “The companion thought of that comment is ‘people call me nigger in this country every day.’ I never heard Ali say ‘white people in this country call me nigger.’ He would attack racism. But he wouldn’t personalize it.” Despite extensive searching by himself and others, Hauser has never found the source of “no Viet Cong ever called me nigger.” He concluded that it was just one of those things that got picked up and passed around in the 60s. It was a comment we wanted Ali to make so badly that we made it for him.\"\n",

      "Mel Bay may cite Marlow as \"\"something of an authority on the ten-string guitar\"\", but also as something of an authority on the ten-string guitar I have reviewed her approach guide and found it misinformative in the following respects:\n",
      " \n",
      "1. In the front matter, Janet Marlow claims that \"\"Narciso Yepes [...] heard that there were four tones with less sustain due to missing sympathetic resonance on the six-string guitar\"\". In truth, Narciso Yepes always, verifiably stated that there are eight notes (from the twelve that make the chromatic octave) that do not have string resonance (i.e. a sympathetic response from an adjacent string). This can be verified in practically any of his various articles and interviews as well as in his Speech of Ingression into the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando delivered on 30 April 1989: \"\"The strings that I have added incorporate all the natural resonance that the instrument lacked in eight of the twelve notes of the equal tempered scale.\"\" That is not only on six-string guitars. Also ten-string guitars that do not have the specific tuning invented by Yepes cannot lay claim to having unison sympathetic string resonances for all the twelve notes in all positions on the treble strings. This is an indisputable fact of acoustics, a science, which as such cannot be fudged.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Marlow does not define the term \"\"resonance\"\", which is used in this book in the lay sense rather than in its acoustic/scientific sense. This is evident from the chapter on \"\"Controlling Resonance\"\" in which controlling \"\"resonance\"\" is equated with a vibrating bass string that has been actively plucked. In fact, this is not string resonance, but simply a vibrating string. Resonance is the tendency of a system (like a string) to vibrate sympathetically at a particular natural frequency in response to energy induced at that frequency (that is, on another string). \n",
      "\n",
      "3. No adequate explanation of how this resonance actually functions is offered anywhere in this book. In fact, the singular tuning that adds all eight missing resonances is relegated to an aside comment in parenthesis. In addition, it is claimed that the author's \"\"own\"\" method of tuning \"\"satisfies the needed sustain\"\" (Preface). As a fact of acoustics, the author's tuning system does not provide sympathetic string resonance for all the notes of a chromatic scale, nor does it thus equalize the sustain, resonance, timbre, or volume among the twelve notes of the octave (which is the entire primary purpose behind the invention of the modern 10-string guitar). The tuning system used in this method, for example, supplies no resonance for the notes of F-natural and B-flat, neither does it offer any resonance for C's. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. In the Preface, Marlow claims that \"\"In my own process over twenty five years I have developed the tuning\"\" that forms the basis for this method. In fact, this method of tuning had already been fully developed by 1982, not \"\"over twenty five years\"\". Records of this are in the March 1982 edition of Guitar Player magazine, in an interview with Marlow by Allan Kozinn. Furthermore, this concept is therein attributed to Oscar Castro-Neves (March 1982: 20), not to Janet Marlow's \"\"own process\"\". \n",
      "\n",
      "5. The transcriptions of baroque music (by Bach and Weiss) offered in this book are fraught with stylistic problems too numerous to list but for a few. For example, the ornaments (which are an integral part of baroque music) have been inexplicably omitted (eg. trills in bars 8 and 15 of the Weiss Courante). Furthermore, stylistically inappropriate melodic intervals have been introduced in the bass line. For example, in bars 1-3 of the Courante, instead of the smooth bass line moving by steps from A2 to G#2 [minor 2nd] to F#2 [major 2nd]) - as intended by Weiss in good baroque style - we find erratic leaps of an augmented octave [A2 to G#1] and a minor 7th [G#1 to F#2]. Where this descending line should be structurally mirrored in bars 36-38, we find again an erratic undermining of the formal and stylistic elements of the composition, simply to keep the bass notes on open strings. As such it seems rather insincere that the author lists \"\"the correct use of octaves and bass lines intended by the composer\"\" as a justification for using the 10-string guitar when this is clearly not the case in her own use of the instrument. Also, very little consideration seems to be shown for open basses ringing together where they should not, for example, the first three bass notes of the Courante all continue to ring together forming two dissonances (augmented octave and minor 7th) where the composer intends a clean line in the bass. That is, the bass line should be a melody, not a cacophany of dissonant harmonic intervals. (I refer also the the DVD version of this book, now discontinued, on which Marlow performs her transcription.) \n",

I'm going to start with the 'Sexualized Portrayal of Quiet' and sadly I'm going to have to tear it apart. Please put how you feel about it or any emotion you may have about the topic aside when you read the following points;\n",
      "\n",
      "1 - No other character in any other Metal Gear title pages is given this amount of scrutiny. Quiet has been highlighted by the media as sexist, this is true. However this is not a reason for an encyclopedic entry to focus on a given character. The page is not a study of the media's (or anyone else's) reaction to Quiet as a character. There should be balance in the reception section, giving a whole section to Quiet versus no other characters is not balanced.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 - Misinformation. \"\"Michael McWhertor criticized Quiet's portrayal, pointing out that while the game explains that her nakedness derives from a photosynthetic skin condition, several other characters with the same condition — such as Code Talker in The Phantom Pain and The End in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater — appear fully clothed.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the source of information, if it is incorrect information it should not be in the entry. Quiet is naked because her lungs were burnt to a crisp, the game specifically mentions this and other fans have mentioned it on the page I believe. Code Talker and The End have the same ability correct, but they did not get set on fire and thrown out of a building. I'm really baffled this is in here because McWhertor is not an authority on this whatsoever. Kojima and the game writers are. Source it correctly or remove the information I would have said.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 - Opinion columns. This baffles me. Why are opinion pieces been taken as reception? They are not professional video game reviewers. By the media's own admission they are just someone writing their opinion about something, it's not objective. They wouldn't even claim to be unbiased as it's an opinion. You are introducing bias here by taking an opinion and presenting it for no reason other than to say \"\"this person didn't like Quiet's portrayal\"\". If tomorrow Donald Trump wrote an opinion piece on Quiet for a media outlet, is that relevant to an encyclopedic entry about something?\n",
      "\n",
      "4 - Further irrelevant information. There are sources and information here that talk about the PlayArtsKai figurine of Quiet. Are you out of your mind?! What relevance does this have to the RECEPTION OF THE GAME??? The video game this entry is about. To start with PlayArtsKai is a completely separate company that we have no idea or information about how much Hideo Kojima was involved with. One would assume since they are completely different companies ENTIRELY that Konami simply licensed the intellectual property rights of Quiet to PlayArtsKai. It goes without saying but Twitter is not a valid source of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "5 - Dates. Numerous sources are reactions to the character Quiet and precede the date of release. Thus they are not a reception of the game itself. Hence why are they in a section called \"\"Reception\"\" to start with.\n",
      "\n",
      "5 - Forbes contributors and Anita Sarkeesian. We seem to have established that Forbes contributors are not valid sources so I expect this will be okay to remove.\n",

      "Mills began his career at 16 as a DJ on his local Hampshire commercial radio station, Power FM, after barraging the station with demo tapes.  He was given the chance to present a weeks worth of shows, and based on the success of this, was immediately offered the 'graveyard slot' of 1:00 am – 6:00 am six nights a week, making him the youngest permanent presenter on mainstream commercial radio.  His popularity led to a quick move to the coveted late afternoon 'drive time'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mills moved from Power FM on to GWR FM and stayed with the station for two years.  His next station was Piccadilly Key 103 in Manchester where he once more progressed quickly from the late night slot to the mid-morning position.  In 1995, Mills moved to the then new London radio station of Heart 106.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mills has provided various voiceovers, including the voice of specialist in-store radio station 'Homebase FM',  the voiceover for Blockbuster Inc.'s in-store infomercial channel 'Blockbuster TV', and more recently, the voiceover for 'The VH1 Album Chart' on UK television channel VH1. \n",

In January 2004, Mills was moved to a weekend afternoon slot, which only lasted for just over 6 months, as in July 2004 he moved over to the weekday early-evening slot, initially covering Sara Cox who was on maternity leave. When Sarah did not return to the slot, Scott took it over as his own The Scott Mills Show.  Mills also provides holiday cover for other slots including The Chris Moyles Show.\n",

      "The Scott Mills Show, in its current format, runs from 4pm to 7pm, Monday to Friday.  It is co-presented by sports reporter and occasional presenter Mark Chapman (Chappers). The assistant producer was Laura Sayers until April 2008. The current assistant producer is Rebecca Huxtable, usually called 'Beccy' or 'Wacky Beccy' on air. The regular newsreader is Tulip Mazumdar.

Second, what does it matter even if it were an \"\"invented term\"\", is that a sin? Is that forbidden in Wikipedia? Third, IT'S A PHRASE pointing out to what type of biologists are being referred to, and there is no law in Wikipedia and it is no sin, to clarify.

Fifth: what does the fact that the mainstream (and it was also left out the \"\"scientific community\"\" mentioned was the MAINSTREAM one (again with the weasel-wording and bigotry) have to do with CRITICISMS of macro-evolution?

No reasons why such tampering might occur have been advanced. And, of course, anyone with access to the publications may check the accuracy, and bring any problems to the attention of editors. The sources for the article span various publications and television programs, so whether they span the web is perhaps not a major consideration. Nevertheless, if other supporting links are available, they should be used in preference. I think it should also be pointed out, as has already been pointed out, that one user who removed the links claiming they were improper, later restored one of those links, because he wished to use it to support an argument. So there is clear evidence of inconsistency by those rejecting these links. That said, users now appear satisfied that the links may remain (to be replaced if and when other links become available), so I would hope that this issue does not need to be reopened without good reason.  \n",

      "To some writers this marriage appears to be a great mystery. How could a foreign chartmaker [NOTE: suddenly he is a chartmaker and not the same \"\"LANERIO DE JANUA\"\" wool weaver of Genoa presented in the Raccolta document XXXXI from 1472, Morison, going against the documents promoted the wool-weaver to a chartmaker? ] of low birth who had been literally “on the beach” a few years before, marry into one of the noble families of the kingdom? Already about 25 years old when she caught young Christopher’s roving eye, her mother was glad enough to have no more convent bills to pay, and as son-in-law to secure an up-and-coming young man of gentlemanly manners, who asked for no dowry. ( Samuel Eliot Morison, Admiral of the Ocean Sea (Little, Brown, Boston, 1942).)\n",
      "THIS previous extract IS A FANTASY INVENTED By MORISON AND A BIG LIE- This is a fabrication by Morison written completely without any proof. Morison did not find anything related to FIlipa's dowry AND the truth is that Filipa’s mother was NOT paying any “convent bills” because Filipa was so privilegded that she lived at the Monastery of Santos belonging to the elite Military Order of Santiago where she had ALL EXPENSES PAID, as a \"\"Comendadora\"\" just like her cousin ANA de MENDONÇA (King John II's Mistress) and her aunt VIOLANTE NOGUEIRA (nanny of King John II's aunts) and even participated in the management of the All-Saints \"\"Comendary\"\". Morison even invented that his “Colombo peasant” was an up-and-coming star, a prodigy as if the mother-in-law, Isabel Moniz, already knew in 1478, only 2 years after supposedly washing ashore penniless (and not able to speak Portuguese or even Italian) that the wool-weaver was going to be a famous STAR in 1493. FURTHERMORE: Filipa's marriage in 1479 HAD to be AUTHORIZED by King John II who was MASTER of the Comendadoras of Santiago. Contrary to what Morison and his supporters of the wool-weaver tale wrote of this fantasy marriage, it was impossible for Filipa Moniz to have married a non-noble two-bit weaver the likes of that Genoese Colombo who had supposedly washed ashore only two years prior from parts unknown with no money, no education, no ship nor even a job in that closed high-class society of Portugal—a noble society so restricted that the Captain of Madeira actually arrested his brother's noble widow for marrying a Nobleman below her station.(1) There is NO DOUBT that Filipa’s husband had to be her equal in social stature and not any wool-weaver. The whole tale invented by Morison of a peasant marrying a Noble Portuguese Captain’s daughter is a perfect example of how inaccurate have been the history books on the history of Admiral Cristóbal Colón.\n",
      "The motivations that bring an author to take such wild liberties with the truth are not intended to be dealt with in this book, however it is something that should alarm all readers because the established pattern had always been one of accepting the \"\"myth of the Genoese weaver\"\" and then twisting the known facts to fit into that tale while at the same time discarding important facts that deny a peasant birth for the discoverer..... Don Fernando Colón who wrote that his father was of noble lineage and not a peasant laborer form anywhere as others were: \"\"Falsely calling him a craftsman ... [as such the Admiral] would not have learned so many letters or sciences ... especially the four main sciences ... Astrology, Cosmography, Geometry and Navigation ... The admiral was a man of letters and of great experience, and did not spend time on things manual or on mechanical arts.(2) Today's investigations and scientific research confirms that Don Fernando Colón was right and that his father could never have been the wool-weaver Colombo, or Pigeon but was instead a Kõlon, or Member of some special noble family.\"\"\n",

This would also make sense as most of the Hollywood writers, creators and producers came from New York City of that era,ever since the begining of the movie industry, and has prolifically and affectionately represented their area origin that gave them so much oppertunities.  24.46.103.28  Veryverser\n",

The newspaper cuttings can be found in date order at Press Cuttings, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton. There are no paqe numbers. In the Michael Aldrich article other references are also used.

For the first claim I found 4 sources in the Press Cuttings plus of course Aldrich's own claims. For the second there are also 4 sources, one peer reviewed. For the third, there is a peer reviewed source and a TV interview by Lawrence McGinty, an acclaimed UK science reporter, broadcast on Independent Television News in the UK in 1984.\n",

This specific collection of barons acclaim their king, who is crowned in Aachen (usually) by the Archbishop of Mainz (almost always).

      "Well, yes, that's fine, but the point here is that there is no publisher's statement made about anything in that sentence. The idea behind having a resource is that we copy what the resource says instead of just listing them as a reference. If the resource says, \"\"Joe at worms\"\" then we write \"\"Joe ate worms\"\". About tarnishing any reputation, that isn't the point at all. And about accepted practices in the publishing world, this is Wikipedia and the accepted practices are covered by what we call \"\"policy and \"\"guidelines\"\" since those came about over a long period of time and through the process of consensus. About people keeping records of how many books were published, I think you missed the point there. Publisher's Weekly magazine has a statement about the number of books among other things for example. They are a secondary source. Do you see how that's different?  About the article on FIP, it hadn't any sources at all which is one of the reasons it was deleted.

      "Hi Asher196. I have come here to follow up with you about Image:MeijerGardensAmericanHorse.jpg‎. I used to contribute a lot of images to wikipedia, back about a year and a half ago I would make trips to specific locations to take high quality pictures for inclusion on Wikipedia. In doing so, I learned more about copyright of photography than most lawyers do (because most lawyers do not work in the copyright space). Suffice to say that your perception of image copyright is an incorrect one. A summary of image copyright has been written elsewhere far better than I can try here, but i am so out of practice on WP I cannot find it. First, please carefully read the copyright template that I have placed upon this image. The image is copyrighted because it is a 2d representation of a 3d statue. Statues, just like paintings, soda can artwork, music and movies are copyrightable. As such, one cannot make derivitives of that work that one can license (i.e. take a picture). If one takes a photograph of a statue, the original copyright holder still retains rights over that image, rights that can only be bent through the implying the fair use provisions of copyright law.\n",

Sadly, this is a battle my side eventually was overcome by noise and numbers generally, but even these nazi's must admit defeat in the face of being able to include photographs of statues. There is no other option. One simply cannot create public domain or freely licensable photographs of statues.

The July entry had to have been written in November since the event (the deaths/funeral music) was listed along with it. But in Mozart's catalog, he listed the MFM ahead of K.478 which was written in October. That sequence is one of several clues that he wrote it in a month preceeding October. For the category of the month of November, he did not enter the MFM. Why not? Because he wrote the piece in July - at least the CHORAL version.

The sequence of those 2 pieces in his catalog plus no mention of the MFM in November should be sufficient evidence that the original music for the MFM was not composed in November. It was just a VERSION of it which was done in November, nearly identical to the first one. He dated the MUSIC correctly, but omitted the first and lesser event of the elevation of a visitng Mason to Master in August.

Assuming the former, and assuming we take \"\"this era\"\" to mean \"\"the Modern era\"\", it counts as a counter-example that Descartes was completely religious; that God was his one of his clear and distinct solutions to the dilemmas in the Meditations. Locke's generally secular outlook on politics had great stake in religion: the man thought atheists were not to be trusted, and was at pains to advocate religious toleration on grounds that did not have to admit the fallibility of religion. The more stark example of Berkeley, already mentioned in the text, is an understatement: it is not just his disputes with Newton, but rather, absolutely anything that Berkeley said, which could not be divorced from his religious views (including his theory of vision). Malebranche is another example. It's my impression that there wasn't a genuine \"\"cooling off\"\" from appeals to religion until the late modern period.

      "The rise and development of the Haskalah, or Jewish enlightenment, was different in Western Europe and Eastern Europe. In the West, an attempt was made to strip Judaism of its national character, and label it merely a \"\"religion.\"\" The motivation behind this was to defend recently acquired political rights; and in particular, the new idea that Jews were citizens of the European \"\"states\"\" in which they resided. In retrospect the giving of political rights to Western European Jewish residents was contingent on their ceasing to be Jews in the traditional sense; or in any sense at all. The “reform” movement, started in Germany, was an attempt to give religious imprimatur to these developments; including rejecting the re-establishment of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem; and thus naming synagogues “temples.” In the East, the Haskalah led to secular Jewish nationalism (e.g., Chaim Zhitlowsky's ideas); of which Zionism was just the most successful and consequential. However, even in the East, there were assimilationists who wanted to dissociate themselves from their heritage to gain approval of gentiles. The “Jew” that is the subject of antisemitism is an artificial construct of the Roman Catholic church; and has no connection to flesh and blood Jews. It was an attempt by Jews to distance themselves from the chimera of Christian theology that later morphed into racism, (invented to attack newly acquired Jewish political rights in Europe), that Jews were attempting, perhaps understandably, to distance themselves from. Even in America, there were references to “Hebrews” instead of “Jews”; in an effort to seek approbation from gentiles; and distance Jews from Christian mythology. (It should be noted that America’s, (i.e., the United States, but not Canada’s), offer of citizenship was genuine and not a quid pro quo.) So your reference to 20th century Hungary was out of context, unexplained, un-encyclopedic; and therefore, inappropriate. That is why I deleted it. talk \"\n",
