## Final Assignment 02 (option 2)

#### Task

You are going to use [KMeans](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) to cluster a set of images **on their metadata.** The measure of success is subjective; you know you have chosen the right features and number of clusters when the images in each cluster "seem" like they belong together. 

Your work will be assessed on: 
1. data processing and transformation  
2. choosing the right number of clusters for the problem  
3. the organization and documentation of your GitHub repository  
4. communication of your work in class reflections and final presentations  
5. model improvement over the semester
